1,"President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. said Monday that his political party, the Partido Federal ng Pilipinas (PFP), has become a formidable force in public service. The President, in a statement made more than a month after the May 12 midterm polls, said the PFP members are now “agents of meaningful growth and progress in the country.” “I convey my most heartfelt greetings to my fellow members of the Partido Federal ng Pilipinas. Thank you all for your continued support, unwavering commitment, and solidarity in uplifting the lives of Filipinos. I am truly proud of what we have accomplished in the past years. Because of our concerted efforts, we have become a formidable force in public service,” he said in a video message. “This is proof that our vision and everything we stand for as a movement and as a party resonate loudly with our people. That is why we must continue to sustain the party's brand of governance that Filipinos have come to expect from us and make sure that our actions are transparent, effective, and responsive to the needs of our citizens,” Marcos added. He then called on his party mates to serve their terms with renewed vigor and strength towards realizing Bagong Pilipinas “where every individual is empowered with greater opportunities.” “Let us commit ourselves to a higher level of excellent leadership and be the visionaries, the trailblazers, and changemakers that society calls for and deserves,” he said. In the May elections, PFP fielded three Senate bets but all of them lost: former Senator and Filipino boxing Hall of Famer Manny Pacquiao, Senator Francis Tolentino and former Secretary Benhur Abalos of the Department of Interior and Local Government. —LDF, GMA Integrated News"
1,"Some Cabinet secretaries have expressed their sentiments regarding the pronouncement of President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. that the public is disappointed with the services provided by the government. Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma told GMA News Online that the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) would ensure the prompt and proper delivery of services to the public. Laguesma added that the agency agrees with the statement that Filipinos are already tired of too much politics. ""The DOLE is in full support of the President's remark that the Filipinos are indeed tired of too much politics that caused division and polarization in our country which has affected the speedy recovery of our economy,"" Laguesma said. ""For our part, DOLE further commits to enhance prompt and proper delivery of services and make our programs accessible to our constituencies particularly the workers,"" he added. Tourism Secretary Christina Frasco, for her part, said the Department of Tourism (DOT) holds firm to the principle that public service must rise above politics, saying that its foremost duty is to serve with integrity and compassion. ""In the face of adversity—both at home and abroad—we remain resolute in advancing programs that uplift lives: by supporting communities, enhancing infrastructure, building local capacities, and sustaining the recovery of our tourism sector,"" Frasco said in a message. Frasco also said the DOT stands united in the country's mission ""to create meaningful employment, empower the countryside, and position the Philippines as a model of inclusive, resilient, and sustainable tourism."" Meanwhile, Budget Secretary Amenah Pangandaman said the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) wholeheartedly fulfills its duties for the nation. She backed the President in emphasizing the importance of prioritizing the people, doing what is right, and ensuring that meaningful and timely services are delivered to Filipinos. ""Inspired by the President's reflections on the 2025 midterm elections, we remain committed to learning from one another and transforming our national goals into tangible actions that reach and uplift every Filipino we are privileged to serve,"" Pangandaman said. Secretary Rex Gatchalian of the Department of Social Welfare and Development said the agency would speed up the delivery of services.''DSWD will double its efforts in making sure that anti-poverty and anti-hunger programs are rolled out faster to make impactful gains in the lives of the Filipino people,'' Gatchalian said in a message. In a podcast with broadcaster Anthony Taberna, Marcos said he has two conclusions in the Eleksyon 2025—the people are tired of politics and they are disappointed with the government. Marcos said, ""Disappointed ang tao sa serbisyo ng gobyerno. Hindi nila nararamdaman at masyadong mabagal ang galaw nang pagbubuo ng mga project na hindi pa nila maramdaman.""

1,"VIENTIANE - ''I always thought that we were but maybe I was deceived.'' This was the response of President Ferdinand ''Bongbong'' Marcos Jr. when asked for his reaction to Vice President Sara Duterte's remark that they had never been friends. Speaking to the Philippine media delegation, Marcos admitted that he was a little dismayed by the Vice President's statement. “I don’t know anymore. I’m not quite sure I understand. I’m a little dismayed to hear that she doesn’t think that we are friends,” Marcos said. Duterte earlier said that she was never friends with Marcos, even though she was the President's running mate in Eleksyon 2022. Duterte, however, said she has close ties with the President’s sister, Senator Imee Marcos. In April of this year, First Lady Louise ''Liza'' Araneta-Marcos also admitted having ill feelings towards the Vice President after the latter’s family made drug accusations against her husband. Duterte was appointed Department of Education (DepEd) secretary on June 30, 2022 but resigned in June this year. Despite her resignation, she had said that she and Marcos ""are still friendly with each other on a personal level.""The Vice President previously said her resignation from DepEd was made in consideration of the department's best interest, particularly that of teachers. However, it was recently revealed that it was because of Speaker Martin Romualdez and House Committee on Appropriations chair Rep. Elizaldy Co ""controlling"" national budget allocations.—LDF, GMA Integrated News"
1,"Vice President Sara Duterte met with her predecessor, former Vice President Leni Robredo, in the latter's residence in Naga City.The information was disclosed by Robredo's spokesperson Barry Gutierrez.""Former VP Leni Robredo was in Naga for the Penafrancia Festival. While she was there, VP Sara Duterte visited her at her house,"" Gutierrez said.According to Gutierrez, the conversation during Duterte's visit was ""personal and not political.""""VP Leni was informed of the visit only minutes before when she was told that VP Sara was already on the way. The visit lasted for about an hour,"" he added.The Dutertes, particularly former President Rodrigo Duterte, are staunch critics of the opposition Liberal Party, which Robredo previously headed. 'Neither looked desperate nor distressed' In a statement, the Office of the Vice President (OVP) said Duterte was invited by a Bicolano friend to attend the centennial anniversary Mass of the Canonical Coronation of Our Lady of Peñafrancia on Friday.""The same friend also arranged a casual meeting with former Vice President Leni Robredo,"" the statement read.""During her stay in Naga, Vice President Duterte visited several prominent Bicol personalities and heard Mass with ordinary Bicolanos. She neither looked desperate nor distressed,"" it added. —LDF/VBL, GMA Integrated News"
1,"Vice President Sara Duterte on Tuesday said efforts of the members of the House of Representatives plotting her impeachment are documented. “As a friend, I will not violate the confidence of a few members of the House of Representatives who have either recorded conversations or participated in shared conversations regarding each impeachment proceedings against me. Nonetheless, this is nothing new,” Duterte said during her opening statement before the House committee on appropriations deliberations on the OVP’s proposed P2 billion budget for 2025. She said that a member of the House already declared in an interview that “in light of the possible numerous violations of the OVP on the use of the P125 million confidential funds which is not in the 2022 General Appropriations Act, we are not discounting the fact that it may file an impeachment case.” This quote about impeachment efforts against her, the Vice President said, was published in a daily newspaper. “Talks on impeachment have been ongoing for several weeks. Surprisingly, despite the absence of proof as to any wrongdoing, she already revealed the grounds for impeachment when she was also quoted as saying especially on the misuse of public funds, technical malversation, and violation of the 1987 Constitution,” Duterte added. Duterte served as the running mate of former Senator Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in the 2022 presidential polls under a ticket dubbed as Uniteam. Cracks in the alliance, however, started to reveal amid alleged political and policy differences. In May 2023, Duterte resigned from Lakas-CMD party as its chairperson and a member, saying that she won’t be able to serve the country amid ""political toxicity“ or undermined by ""execrable political powerplay."" She did not drop names, but Lakas-CMD’s president and Duterte’s 2022 campaign manager is Speaker Martin Romualdez, cousin of Marcos. In June this year, Duterte resigned as Education Secretary ""out of concern for teachers and students."" The Marcos administration was also seen reversing his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte's policies such as the war on drugs and South China Sea. —LDF, GMA Integrated News"
1,"Vice President Sara Duterte expressed her sentiments on Saturday after an ally referred to her as the new leader of the opposition following her departure from President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s administration. “Sa trabaho ko at sa pagkatao ko at sa prinsipyo ko, hindi ako gumagalaw for the administration, for the opposition, or kung anuman ‘yang political na ‘yan. Ang galaw ko ay base sa kung ano ‘yung makakatulong sa ating mga kababayan, at kung ano ‘yung karapat-dapat,” Duterte said in an ambush interview in Cebu City on the sidelines of the Pasidungog awards for partners of the OVP in the implementation of various programs. (I don't move for the administration, opposition, or any other political cause in my work, character, or principles. My actions are guided by what will benefit our fellow citizens and what is right.) Duterte said she is currently focused on the 30-day transition plan for all the strands in the Department of Education Central Office and the projects and activities of the Office of the Vice President. ''Sa politics, wala,'' she said. (For politics, there is none.) Former presidential spokesperson Harry Roque earlier claimed that Duterte is now the leader of the opposition after the supposed breakup of the Marcos-Duterte alliance in light of her resignation as DepEd secretary and vice chairperson of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC). Speaker Martin Romualdez, however, said Duterte should be the one making the announcement about her political plans. “I guess we'll have to just hear it from the VP if and when the time comes for her to make statements or to make any policy or statements on policies of the national government,” Romualdez said in a press conference on Monday. Meanwhile, Albay Representative Edcel Lagman said the Liberal Party is still the ""genuine opposition.” Former president Duterte, sons preparing for 2025 elections In the same interview, Duterte reiterated that her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, and her two brothers are all planning to run for the Senate in the 2025 midterm elections. ""Ah yes sa pagkakaalam ko, kung kakausapin ko ang grupo ni former President Duterte, sabi nila handa silang tumakbo, at kung kakausapin ko rin ang mas nakakatanda kong kapatid na lalake na si Pulong Duterte sabi rin niya handa rin siyang tumakbo bilang senador. At kung kausapin ko rin ang mga tao na nakapalibot sa aking nakababatang kapatid, si Baste, nasasabi rin nila na handa rin sila o naghahanda sila na tumakbo pagka senador,"" Sara said in Cebuano. (Ah yes, as far as I know, if I talk to the group of former President Duterte, they say they are ready to run, and if I talk to my older brother, (Paolo) Pulong Duterte, he also says he is ready to run for senator. And if I talk to the people around my younger brother (Sebastian) Baste, they also say they are also ready or they are preparing him to run for senator.) Twelve seats will be available in the Senate next year. Duterte said that her mother advised her to go back to Davao City to run again as mayor. Previously asked if she would resign as Vice President as well, Duterte said, “Walang ganon na usapan (There are no talks about that).” —VBL, GMA Integrated News"
1,"Senator Robin Padilla on Thursday said that his party-mate and former President Rodrigo Duterte is not against President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. despite past tirades. “Una po si mayor (President Duterte) ang aming...pagdating sa partido, siya ang aming supreme leader. Definitely, nasa kanya ang support ng lahat ng PDP. Ang nangyaring annual meeting at endorsement ng tatakbong senador, nag-speech si mayor, ang sabi ni mayor ayaw niya ng gulo,” Padilla said, referring to Duterte’s speech which he delivered during the PDP anniversary event in Cebu last April 19. (The former President is the party's supreme leader and we had an annual meeting, endorsement of Senate bets for 2025. He gave a speech and he said he does not want chaos.) “Ayaw niya ng makipag-away. Gusto lang niya maging maayos sila PBBM (President Bongbong Marcos). Sabi niya, siya ay nakasuporta at naniniwala siyang si PBBM di involved sa katiwalian. Kaya kumbaga doon kami nakatindig, ang PDP,” Padilla added. (He does not want to pick a fight and wishes the President well, that he supports him and the President is not involved in corruption. That is where the party stands.) Padilla made the response to the query if he shares the sentiment of his fellow PDP party members who have expressed support for the incumbent president.  PDP is headed by Duterte. Duterte earlier called Marcos “bangag” or high on illegal drugs, alleged that the President is after a term extension, and branded him a ""crybaby"" for allegedly always seeking out United States’ aid amid Chinese aggression in the West Philippine Sea. During his April 19 speech, Duterte said he does not harbor ill feelings toward Marcos and that he has not heard of reports linking the president to corruption. “Si Marcos, in fairness, walang halong galit, walang halong pulitika. Wala akong naririnig na siya ay involved sa corruption,” the former leader said. “Antayin na lang natin. One term lang naman. Huwag na natin awayin,” Duterte said. (Let’s just wait. It is just one term anyway. Let’s not pick a fight.) Marcos had said that his relationship with the Duterte family is complicated but did not elaborate.—LDF, GMA Integrated News"
1,"An alleged plan to oust President Juan Miguel Zubiri from his position was an attempt to discredit the upper house, senators said on Monday. Over the weekend, there were speculations that several senators had signed a resolution seeking to replace Zubiri as Senate president. Members of the majority bloc denied any such attempt. Among them were Senate Majority Leader Joel Villanueva, Senate President Pro Tempore Loren Legarda, Senators Imee Marcos, Nancy Binay, Grace Poe, JV Ejercito, Sonny Angara, Francis Tolentino, Ronald dela Rosa, Sherwin Gatchalian, and Jinggoy Estrada. In an ambush interview, Zubiri said he had heard of the alleged plot last week. ""I serve at the pleasure of my colleagues. I am extremely honored to serve at the pleasure of my colleagues. Ganon na lang naman yan. I leave it to the wisdom of my majority,"" Zubiri said. As to where these speculations originated, Zubiri said, ""Alam mo naman, there is a concerted effort to discredit the Senate. Nalaman ko pa 'yan last week pa."" The Senate President said he had been talking with his colleagues, adding that other senators were unaware of such a plot. In a separate ambush interview, Villanueva said the senators were ""solidly behind"" Zubiri and questioned the timing of the soc-called speculations. Ejercito shared the same view, adding that there were  ""divide and conquer"" moves against the Senate. Villanueva and Ejercito said it would be difficult to replace Zubiri at this point, and they could not see anyone else taking his place as Senate president. — DVM, GMA Integrated News"
1,"Sinabi ni Senador Bong Go na hinikayat ni dating Pangulo at ngayo'y House Deputy Speaker Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo na maging aktibo muli sa pulitika si dating Pangulong Rodrigo Duterte. Inihayag ito ng senador makaraan siyang mag-post sa Facebook ng mga larawan mula sa “informal” meeting nitong weekend nina Arroyo, Duterte, dating Senate President Vicente Sotto III, at dating Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea. “Isang simpleng kamustahan at masayang pagkikita ang nangyari kasama ang mga pinunong naglingkod sa bayan sa iba’t ibang posisyon o kapasidad noong mga nakaraang administrasyon. Nagbalik-tanaw sila sa mga panahong nagkasama sila sa gobyerno,” ayon sa caption ni Go. “Sa nasabing pagkikita, kinukumbinsi din ni dating pangulong Arroyo si dating pangulong Duterte na maging aktibo muli sa pulitika,” dagdag ng senador. Ayon kay Go, inimbitahan ni Arroyo si Duterte sa isang “informal” meeting sa pamamagitan ng isa nitong tauhan. Nataon umano na nasa Maynila si Duterte. “Inanyayahan ni dating pangulong Gloria Arroyo, sa pamamagitan ng kanilang mga staff, sa isang impormal na pagkikita si dating pangulong Rodrigo Duterte na nasa Maynila noong panahong iyon.  Nagkataong magkasama kami ni Tatay Digong noon matapos ko siyang samahan sa kanyang medical checkup sa hospital, gaya ng dati kong ginagawa sa kanya,” saad ni Go, na dating personal aide ni Duterte. “[D]ahil bihira lang naman na pumunta sa Maynila sa ngayon si dating pangulong Duterte, sumabay na rin sa pagkikitang iyon, sa tulong ni dating executive secretary Salvador Medialdea, si dating Senate president Tito Sotto na gusto ring makamusta ng personal ang kanyang itinuturing na kaibigan na si Tatay Digong,” paliwanag pa niya.

He, however, said he will stay as a member of PDP-Laban. “Today, May 29, I tender my irrevocable resignation as EVP of PDP-Laban.

1,"Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim has been named prime minister, the palace said in a statement Thursday, ending a days-long political impasse after inconclusive polls. ""After taking into consideration the views of Their Royal Highnesses the Malay Rulers, His Majesty has given consent to appoint Anwar Ibrahim as the 10th Prime Minister of Malaysia,"" the statement said. At the weekend election, Anwar's Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope) coalition won the most seats, 82, on an anti-graft message -- but fell short of the required 112-seat majority. Former prime minister Muhyiddin Yassin's Perikatan Nasional (National Alliance) bloc grabbed 73. Muhyiddin, who was backed by an Islamist party, later told reporters that since no bloc had enough numbers, the king had initially asked him and Anwar to form a ""unity government"". Malaysia's king, Sultan Abdullah Ahmad Shah, had summoned the two rivals in a bid to break the deadlock. —Agence France-Presse"
1,"As part of Tuesday's midterm elections in the United States, voters cast ballots in around 100 referendums, some of which have life-changing implications. This is what American voters decided: Healthcare It was no surprise that abortion rights, a major political issue in the run-up to the vote, featured on the ballot in several states. And the referendums handed a series of victories to abortion rights activists. Voters in California, Vermont, and Michigan agreed to amend their state constitutions to include abortion rights. More unexpectedly, voters in conservative and religious Kentucky rejected an anti-abortion measure, and preliminary results show Montana is headed in the same direction. And in a country known for some of the world's highest healthcare costs, the issue of medical fees was also on the ballot. In South Dakota, a Republican state, a large majority of voters opted to expand access to the Medicaid health insurance program to more low-income earners. Meanwhile, preliminary results show Arizona is on track to approve a measure to lower maximum interest rates on medical debt. Slavery More than 150 years after slavery was abolished, several states voted on an exception to the 13th Amendment, which allows for forced labor by prisoners. Alabama, Oregon, Tennessee, and Vermont voted to prohibit enslavement or involuntary servitude as punishment for crimes or payment of debts or fines. The votes will not automatically change conditions for prisoners but could lead to legal proceedings. Only Louisiana rejected the proposal, after the text of the referendum had been criticized as too convoluted. Some 20 states still authorize this type of forced labor. Recreational drugs Issues around the recreational use of drugs are popular in US referendums, and this year was no different. Arkansas, North and South Dakota voted against legalizing the recreational use of marijuana and authorizing limited possession of pot. However, Maryland and Missouri residents voted in favor and will join 19 other states and Washington, where it is already legal. In Colorado, votes are still being counted in a referendum which seeks to decriminalize the possession and use of so-called ""magic mushrooms"" and other psychedelic natural substances. Minimum wages A vast majority of voters in the capital Washington -- a Democrat stronghold -- voted for employees who work for tips to earn the minimum wage of $16,10 by 2027. These employees, who mainly work in the food service industry, have until now earned a minimum of $5,35 per hour. Nebraska voters approved a similar initiative, to see the state's minimum wages rise progressively from $9 to $15 by 2026. Electoral laws Tuesday's election also highlighted tensions around voting rules in the United States. Accusations of fraud have flourished among Republican voters, despite being repeatedly dismissed by authorities. Several referendums grew from efforts to contest the results of the 2020 presidential election and called for changes to rules governing elections. Connecticut and Michigan chose to legalize early voting in elections, while Nebraska agreed on a measure obliging voters to provide photo identification when casting their ballot in future elections. —Agence France-Presse"
1,"Myanmar's military chief said Friday the junta is open to negotiations with ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi to end the crisis sparked by its coup after her trials in a junta-run court have concluded. Suu Kyi, 77, has been detained since the generals toppled her government in a coup on February 1 last year and plunged the Southeast Asian nation into chaos. She has been jailed for 17 years for a clutch of charges and faces decades more in prison if convicted on a raft of other charges she is battling in a closed junta court. ""After the legal processes against her according to the law are finished we are going to consider (negotiations) based on her response,"" junta chief Min Aung Hlaing said in a statement. Journalists have been barred from the proceedings, her lawyers gagged from speaking to the media, and the junta has given no indication of when her trials might conclude. The military regime's cases against Suu Kyi were proceeding according to law, the junta chief said. He also cited the case of South Korean president Park Geun-hye who ""was also sentenced according to the law"" for corruption in 2018. Park was later pardoned and released. Other charges against Suu Kyi include seven counts of corruption, breaking electoral law and breaching the colonial-era official secrets law -- for which she is co-accused with detained Australian economist Sean Turnell. Both face up to 15 years in jail if found guilty on that charge. There was enough evidence against Turnell for a ""serious conviction,"" Min Aung Hlaing said. The junta could be lenient if the Australian government ""acted positively"", he said, without providing details. In July a junta spokesman told AFP it was ""not impossible"" that the regime would enter into dialogue with Suu Kyi to resolve the turmoil sparked by the military's power-grab last year. Stalled diplomacy Suu Kyi remains a revered figure locally for her courageous opposition to a previous junta, despite her international reputation suffering after governing in a power-sharing deal with the generals when she won elections in 2015. But many of those currently embroiled in fighting with the military have said the movement must go further than what the Nobel laureate led decades ago. Dissidents today -- including so-called ""People's Defense Forces"" that have sprung up to fight junta forces -- say the goal now is to permanently root out military dominance from the country's politics and economy. Diplomatic efforts by the 10-country bloc Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) -- of which Myanmar is a member -- have so far failed to halt the bloodshed. Last year, the bloc agreed on a ""five-point consensus"", which calls for a cessation of violence and constructive dialogue, but the junta has largely ignored it. This week UN special envoy Noeleen Heyzer made her first trip to the country since being appointed last year and met Min Aung Hlaing and other top military officials. But she was denied a meeting with Suu Kyi, and rights groups said they had little optimism her visit would persuade the military to end its bloody crackdown and engage in dialogue with opponents of its coup. More than 2,200 people have been killed and over 15,000 arrested in the military's crackdown on dissent since it seized power, according to a local monitoring group. —Agence France-Presse"
1,"When emotions and personal convictions run high due to politics, conflict with whom you disagree is inevitable. The Philippine national elections just wrapped up last Monday, May 9. And while the results are still partial and unofficial, online bardagulan has only escalated, resulting in ""unfriending,"" ""unfollowing,"" and ""blocking"" among social media users. On ""Unang Hirit"" Thursday, licensed psychiatrist Dr. Joan Mae Perez-Rifareal said heightened emotions can affect our thinking brain. “Itong time ng post-election, medyo heightened ang emotions ng iba sa ating mga kababayan. Especially pag may loss, pag dumadaan tayo sa grieving process or parang pag may nawala. Be it nawalang opportunity, nawalang plans for the future,” Dr. Rifareal began. “Pag heightened ang ating emotions, nawawala ang logical or thinking brain or ating objectivity sa pagtingin sa mga issues,” she explained. So, during this time of high emotions and conflict, she advised everyone, especially those who consume social media a lot, to keep an ""open line of communication."" “What does this mean? Dapat ‘wag tayo judgmental. Mas maganda pakinggan nating ang opinyon ng ating mga kamag-anak at friends. Be compassionate, understanding; open mindedness para maging healthy po ang ating discussions,” she further explained. According to Dr. Rifareal, ""blocking,"" ""unfriending,"" and ""unfollowing"" are already ""extreme"" as there several other ways to lessen our interaction with people we don't want to be associated with. She suggests hiding or muting the them first, “para 'di tayo ma-notify. Mas magiging quiet ang ating notifications. In the end, mas maganda that we remain at peace with everyone. Proseso po ito, at aabot din po tayo sa point na tayo ay magkakaisa at magkakaintindihan in the end,” she added. When asked if she has any tips on restoring broken relationships due to different political views, the doctor reiterated that heightened emotions should be processed first. “Hindi natin masasabi na one day lang, okay na lahat. It will take months or years pero mas maganda po, reassure natin na kung ano man ang mangayari, andito pa rin ang ating friendship,” she advised. For now, the best way to do, according to Dr. Rifareal, is to ""set boundaries."" “Set limits, especially when it comes to relationships at kung ito ay nakakaapekto na sa ating functionality sa trabaho at schooling, mas maganda aware po tayo sa ating emosyons,” she concluded.

1,"US actress Whoopi Goldberg on Tuesday was suspended from the talk show she hosts for two weeks after saying that the Nazi genocide of six million Jews ""was not about race."" Despite an apology from the host of ""The View"" talk show, ABC News President Kim Godwin said she had decided it was not enough. ""Effective immediately, I am suspending Whoopi Goldberg for two weeks for her wrong and hurtful comments,"" Godwin said in a statement posted on the TV channel's public relations Twitter account. US actress Whoopi Goldberg suspended from the talk show she hosts for two weeks after saying the Nazi genocide of six million Jews ""was not about race""https://t.co/WQnFYFy1ag pic.twitter.com/ytBhzFXIJt ""While Whoopi has apologized, I've asked her to take time to reflect and learn about the impact of her comments,"" Godwin said. The Oscar-winning TV personality said on the ABC's ""The View"" that the Holocaust involved ""two white groups of people."" ""On today's show, I said the Holocaust 'is not about race, but about man's inhumanity to man'. I should have said it is about both,"" Goldberg wrote in a Twitter apology late Monday. ""The Jewish people around the world have always had my support and that will never waiver. I'm sorry for the hurt I have caused,"" the 66-year-old added. After Goldberg's comments, critics pointed out that race was central to the genocide, with the Nazis believing themselves to be a master race. ""No @WhoopiGoldberg, the #Holocaust was about the Nazi's systematic annihilation of the Jewish people - who they deemed to be an inferior race,"" tweeted Jonathan Greenblatt, head of the Anti-Defamation League. ""They dehumanized them and used this racist propaganda to justify slaughtering six million Jews. Holocaust distortion is dangerous,"" he added. The US Holocaust Museum posted on Twitter that ""racism was central to Nazi ideology."" ""Jews were not defined by religion, but by race. Nazi racist beliefs fueled genocide and mass murder,"" it said, without referencing Goldberg's comments. The host spoke during a discussion about a Tennessee school banning the 1986 graphic novel ""Maus: A Survivor's Tale,"" about life at the Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz. The Pulitzer Prize-winning book, which depicts Jews as mice and Nazis as cats, has long been heralded as a powerful and accurate depiction of the Nazi murder of millions of Jews during World War II.

1,"Senator Panfilo Lacson on Monday advised voters to be more discerning when exercising their right to vote, adding that they must not be swayed by ""politics of entertainment."" Lacson said he supports amending the presidential qualifications, citing that it is a ""daunting"" task. Under the 1987 Constitution, qualifications of a president must be a natural-born citizen of the Philippines, a registered voter, able to read and write, at least forty years of age on the day of the election, and a resident of the Philippines for at least ten years immediately preceding such election. ""Dapat baguhin yung qualifications, baguhin, itaas natin kasi yung trabaho katakot-takot ang trabaho... Very daunting ang dapat gawin, hindi lang daunting lalo sa pandemya, lalong daunting 'yun tapos bibigyan mo ng natural born, at least 40 years of age, tapos able to read and write parang 'di tugma sa sign of the times,"" Lacson said in an interview with Boy Abunda. But he said ""bottomline, it is up to the people to decide"" on the qualifications of the top Philippine leader.

'Wag tayong padala sa politics of entertainment, du'n naman tayo sa mas serious,"" he said. ""Problema kulang sa pag-aaral, na kung saan nadadala sila... Alam mo na doon sa nakapagbigay ng dole out,"" he added. Lacson said he can be flexible with the campaign but he stressed that he wants to be serious by focusing on addressing the issues.

1,"A delegation of French senators led by a former defense minister arrived on Wednesday in Taiwan, where they will hold talks with President Tsai Ing-wen, despite strong protests from China. Beijing opposes Taipei having any official diplomatic exchanges and has aggressively tried to dissuade politicians from visiting in recent years. The Chinese embassy warned that the visit would damage the interests of China, Chinese-French relations and ""the image of France"" in recent comments on its website. France's foreign ministry has dismissed China's protests, saying the senators were free to make their own decisions about their travel plans. The delegation will meet Tsai on Thursday before wrapping up their trip on Sunday, according to Taiwan's foreign ministry. ""The senators are making the visit despite threats from the Chinese ambassador to France, showing their steadfast commitment to the spirit of freedom and democracy,"" the ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. The Chinese ambassador wrote to the leader of the French delegation, Alain Richard, in February, saying his visit would ""clearly violate the one-China principle and send the wrong signal to pro-independence forces in Taiwan"". Richard chairs the French senate's Taiwan Friendship Group and previously visited the island in 2015 and 2018. Beijing has ramped up pressure on self-ruled democratic Taiwan since Tsai came to power in 2016, as she views the island as a de facto sovereign nation and not part of its territory. —Agence France-Presse"
1,"PRESOV, Slovakia - Pope Francis said on Tuesday that the cross should not be used as a political symbol and warned against Christians trying to be triumphalist, in an apparent criticism of the use of religion for partisan ends. Francis flew to the city of Presov, in eastern Slovakia, where he presided at a long service known as a Divine Liturgy, a Byzantine rite used by Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Churches. The pope wove his homily around the theme of Christian identity, saying crosses and crucifixes were often used superficially by Christians. Speaking to about 30,000 worshippers, he said many Christians had crucifixes or crosses around their necks, on walls in their homes, in their cars and in their pockets but had no real relationship with Jesus. ""What good is this, unless we stop to look at the crucified Jesus and open our hearts to him,"" he said. ""Let us not reduce the cross to an object of devotion, much less to a political symbol, to a sign of religious and social status."" In 1950 in Presov, the communist authorities forced the Eastern Rite Catholics, who owe their allegiance to the Pope, to join the Orthodox Church. A number of Eastern Rite clerics who refused were jailed. APPEAL TO RELIGION In Hungary, where the pope stopped briefly on Sunday, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has appealed to religious sentiment in his anti-immigrant and nationalist politics, saying that Hungary's Christian heritage risked disappearing. After his meeting with the pope on Sunday, Orban said he asked the pontiff ""not to let Christian Hungary perish"". The pope said in Hungary that the country could preserve its Christian roots while opening up to the needy. At the liturgy on Tuesday, Francis also again appeared to warn Christians against the use of their religion in so-called culture wars that he believes hurt the common good. ""How often do we long for a Christianity of winners, a triumphalist Christianity that is important and influential, that receives glory and honour?"" he said. In Slovakia, the far-right Kotlebovci-People's Party Our Slovakia says it stands on three pillars - Christian, national and social - and has vowed to prevent immigration of mostly Muslim refugees. ""The cross is not a flag to wave, but the pure source of a new way of living,"" Francis said, adding that a true believer ""views no one as an enemy, but everyone as a brother or sister"". A number of political parties in Europe, including several far-right parties in the east, use crosses on their party flags or symbols. In Hungary, one of Orban's government allies, the tiny Christian Democratic Peoples' Party (KDNP), uses a cross on their symbol. The far-right nationalist Our Homeland Party (Mi Hazank) uses the Byzantine cross, which has two horizontal beams. The pope later visited one of the most impoverished communities in Slovakia, a settlement of Roma people, where he condemned prejudice and discrimination against them, saying it was wrong to pigeonhole entire ethnic groups. He then held a rally with young Slovak Catholics attended by around 20,000 people at a stadium in Kosice before he was due to return to Bratislava. He returns to Rome on Wednesday. --- Reuters"
1,"As parts of the country get battered by the enhanced southwest monsoon, President Rodrigo Duterte made an entreaty for good weather, including favorable “political weather” in the coming days. “Let us pray that the weather, the political weather, and the weather of climate change will be kind to us. Thank you very much,” Duterte said, concluding a taped Cabinet briefing Saturday. Duterte is set to give his last State of the Nation Address (SONA) on Monday. Administration critics will also hold protests at the same time. President Rodrigo Duterte has said that he is considering a vice presidential bid in 2022 to avoid being a lame duck during his last year in office. His daughter, Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte has topped recent surveys from among the possible candidates for president next year. Earlier in his message, Duterte also expressed gratitude to health experts that lent their aid to the government. “My papasalamat, utang na loob ko sa inyo, na tinutulungan niyo kami, lalo na ‘yung mga experts, doctors, or scientists,” he said. The Philippines has logged 1,543,281 confirmed cases. Of this 1,461,749 have recovered and 27,131 have died. Meanwhile, at least 14,000 people have been preemptively evacuated due to threats of flooding brought by the rains from the enhanced monsoon.—LDF, GMA News"
1,"Madrid residents on Tuesday handed a resounding victory to the region's hardline leader Isabel Diaz Ayuso who has soared in prominence for stubbornly resisting virus restrictions. With nearly all the votes counted, the results showed a solid win for Ayuso, a rising star in the right-wing Popular Party (PP), who won almost 45 percent of the votes, handing a stinging defeat to Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's Socialists. ""Today begins a new chapter in the history of Spain,"" a teary-eyed Ayuso declared in her victory speech, her words echoing that of PP chief Pablo Casado who declared the result to be ""a turning point for national politics"". With 95 percent of the votes counted, Ayuso more than doubled her party's showing in the 2019 ballot, winning 65 of the regional parliament's 136 seats, while the Socialists shed 13 seats to secure just 24. Falling shy of an absolute majority of 69 seats, the 42-year-old will be forced to seek support to rule from the far-right Vox which secured 13 seats -- an option she has said ""wouldn't be the end of the world"". With the left facing with a major defeat, Pablo Iglesias, head of the far-left Podemos, junior partner in Spain's ruling coalition, announced he was stepping down from politics. ""We have failed, we have been very far from putting together a sufficient majority,"" he said, just seven weeks after standing down as deputy prime minister to run as his party's candidate in a risky gamble he ultimately lost. ""When you are no longer useful, you need to know when to withdraw,"" he admitted. Although the party secured more votes than last time, with just 10 seats it will remain a minor player in the regional parliament while its hard-left rival Mas Madrid secured 24. Heroine of hospitality At the helm of Spain's richest region for just over 18 months, Ayuso has been one of the leading critics of Sanchez's leftist government and its handling of the pandemic. An outspoken hardliner, she has won widespread support for resisting government pressure to impose tighter restrictions on the local economy. Madrid is the only major European capital that has kept bars, restaurants and theatres open since the national lockdown ended in June 2020. Just over 5.1 million people were eligible to vote in Tuesday's election, which comes after a bitterly-fought and divisive campaign in a region that has been ruled by the PP for 26 years. From the early hours, there were long queues outside polling stations, with turnout standing at 76 percent, some 11 percentage points higher than 2019. Although Madrid has suffered Spain's highest numbers of infections and deaths, Ayuso consistently defied calls to shut bars and restaurants, with the hospitality sector regarding her as a heroine. 'Beer is important' Her call for a snap election caught the political establishment by surprise but was an astute move aimed at cashing in on the political capital she had clearly accrued. With ""freedom"" her campaign slogan, the populist leader focused on people's need for normality, despite the pandemic. ""Having beers is important,"" she said last month. ""After a bad day, a beer cheers you up."" Although critics had said her lax restrictions had ultimately cost lives in a region where almost 15,000 coronavirus patients have died -- one in five of Spain's overall toll of 78,000 -- her business-focused approach paid off at the polls. ""Ayuso deserves to be loved for what she's done in keeping bars open and saving jobs,"" said 63-year-old civil servant Jose Luis Cordon after casting his ballot for the PP. Although the left had tried to warn voters about Ayuso's likely tie-up with Vox, their words appeared to fall on deaf ears. Despite the left taking a drubbing, analysts said it wouldn't have a major impact on Spain's ruling coalition, although it would likely exacerbate the antagonism between the PP and the government. —Agence France-Presse"
1,"The Philippines has dissociated from a United Nations Human Rights Council  resolution demanding the release of deposed Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been in detention since the military takeover. In a statement, the Department of Foreign Affairs said the Philippines took the same position as China, Russia, Venezuela and Bolivia ""in dissociating itself"" from the resolution despite a consensus to adopt the resolution without a vote. In its statement to the UNHRC, the Philippines said it reaffirms its support of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Myanmar, but stressed that ""foreign solutions whether in regional or multilateral contexts, including through this Council""  should never be imposed. The 47-member Council based in Geneva adopted unanimously without a vote the resolution brought by the United Kingdom and European Union, which called for the release of Suu Kyi and other detained officials and to allow a UN monitoring team to visit Myanmar. According to the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Philippines did not join the consensus to adopt the resolution, but did not block or object to it. Myanmar's military takeover sparked pro-democracy protests across the country since last week, defying government ban on mass gatherings. ""The Philippines has been supportive of Myanmar’s progress towards a fuller democracy, cognizant of the Army’s role in preserving its territorial integrity and national security, as well as the unifying role of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi in the history of the country and Army her father founded,"" the Philippine statement said. ""The Lady is a deeply and widely admired icon of democracy among the Filipino people who identify with her and her people, given similar struggles against tyranny in the not distant past; struggles that culminated in the complete restoration of democracy by unprecedented and entirely domestic efforts that inspired similarly successful efforts in the rest of the Cold War world."" It added, the full realization of Myanmar's democratic process can only be achieved thru ""complete restoration of the status quo ante."" ""Myanmar made important strides towards democratization in the past decade with the political presence of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, constitutional constraints on her key political role notwithstanding. This was clear in Myanmar’s engagement in the Universal Periodic Review last month,"" the Philippine statement said. ""The Philippines will settle for nothing less than, and nothing else but the complete restoration of the status quo in which Myanmar had made so much progress."" —LBG, GMA News"
1,"Protesters returned to the streets of Myanmar's capital Naypyitaw on Wednesday after the most violent day yet in demonstrations against a coup that halted a tentative transition to democracy under elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The United States and United Nations condemned the use of force against protesters, who demand the reversal of the coup and the release of Suu Kyi and other detained leaders of her National League for Democracy (NLD) and activists. ""We cannot stay quiet,"" youth leader Esther Ze Naw told Reuters. ""If there is blood shed during our peaceful protests, then there will be more if we let them take over the country."" In Naypyitaw, hundreds of government workers marched in support of a civil disobedience campaign that has been joined by doctors, teachers and railway workers, among others. A doctor said one protester was expected to die from a gunshot wound to the head in Tuesday's protests. She was wounded when police fired guns, mostly in the air, to clear protesters in Naypyitaw. Three other people were being treated for wounds from suspected rubber bullets, doctors said. Protesters were also hurt in Mandalay and other cities, where security forces used water cannon as well. State media reported injuries to police during their attempts to disperse protesters, who were accused of throwing stones and bricks. The U.S. State Department said it was reviewing assistance to Myanmar to ensure those responsible for the coup face ""significant consequences"". ""We repeat our calls for the military to relinquish power, restore democratically elected government, release those detained and lift all telecommunication restrictions and to refrain from violence,"" spokesman Ned Price said in Washington. The United Nations called on Myanmar's security forces to respect people's right to protest peacefully. ""The use of disproportionate force against demonstrators is unacceptable,"" Ola Almgren, the U.N. representative in Myanmar, said. The protests are the largest in Myanmar for more than a decade, reviving memories of almost half a century of direct army rule and spasms of bloody uprisings until the military began a process of withdrawing from civilian politics in 2011. The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners recorded nearly 60 people arrested in various parts of Myanmar on Tuesday. Critical condition A doctor in Naypyitaw said the woman who was shot in the head with a live bullet remained in a critical condition but was not expected to survive. Social media video verified by Reuters showed her with other protesters some distance from a row of riot police as a water cannon sprayed and several shots could be heard. The woman, wearing a motorcycle helmet, suddenly collapsed. Pictures of her helmet showed what appeared to be a bullet hole. Myanmar's army took power citing unsubstantiated allegations of fraud in a Nov. 8 election that Suu Nkyi's NLD party won in a landslide. The electoral commission had dismissed the army's complaints. Late on Tuesday, police raided the NLD's headquarters in Yangon during the hours of a military-imposed curfew. The raid was carried out by about a dozen police personnel, who forced their way into the building in the commercial capital after dark, elected lawmakers said. Suu Kyi's party had been due to start a second term on the day of the coup. Alongside the protests, a civil disobedience movement has affected hospitals, schools and government offices. Staff from the electricity and power ministry in Naypyitaw were among the latest to join the civil disobedience movement on Wednesday. Protesters' demands now go beyond reversing the coup. They also seek the abolition of a 2008 constitution drawn up under military supervision that gave the generals a veto in parliament and control of several ministries, and for a federal system in ethnically diverse Myanmar. Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for campaigning for democracy and spent nearly 15 years under house arrest. The 75-year-old faces charges of illegally importing six walkie-talkies and is being held in detention until Feb. 15. Her lawyer said he has not been allowed to see her. Suu Kyi remains hugely popular at home despite damage to her international reputation over the plight of the Muslim Rohingya minority. —Reuters"

1,"An international commission to investigate alleged human rights violations in the Philippines was launched on Thursday. In a statement, the Independent International Commission of Investigation into Human Rights Violations in the Philippines or Investigate PH said it was created under a resolution of the 45th UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) session in October last year. “Investigate PH is a critical space of solidarity and accompaniment of the people of the Philippines as it investigates the blatant violation and violence related to the basic human rights of people,” said commissioner Rev. Michael Blair, who is also the general secretary of the United Church of Canada’s General Council. The resolution was pushed with the victims and the international community’s demand for an independent probe on the country involving rights abuses. Investigate PH is composed of leaders of international lawyers’ groups, political leaders and global church groups, who will gather information about the human rights issues in the country. According to the commission, over 200 people from lawyers organizations, civil society, and churches from different countries came together to manifest their support for the global project. “The gravity of the violations underlines why the world needs to know about these human rights abuses and to act to stop the crimes,” said commissioner Lee Rhiannon, who is a former senator in Australia. I put it to everyone at this event that if we were Filipinos, we would surely have suffered under the Duterte government. The evidence is overwhelming. The testimonies [are] tragic,” Rhiannon added. During the launch, the commission called on the international community to act now on the human rights abuses supposedly perpetrated by the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte. Investigate PH is composed of the following leaders: The commission will gather evidence on crimes against humanity in relation to Duterte’s “war on drugs” and the persecution of human rights defenders and civil society organizations. Reports from the Investigate PH will be submitted to UNHRC and International Criminal Court. —LBG, GMA News"
1,"Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday said the social network will no longer recommend politics-themed groups to users, a measure already taken in the US due to election tensions. The social media giant is aiming to shine up an image tarnished by the political controversy, including Donald Trump's rise the White House. ""We plan to keep civic and political groups out of recommendations for the long term and we plan to expand that policy globally,"" Zuckerberg said in an earnings call. He added that Facebook would also reduce political content in users' main news feeds as part of a push ""to turn down the temperature and discourage divisive conversation."" The move makes permanent steps taken by Facebook to guard against being a platform for violent or misleading messages during the US presidential election. Facebook last week said it is asking its independent experts to rule on whether former president Trump's suspension for ""fomenting insurrection"" should stand. Facebook and Instagram suspended Trump after his supporters stormed the US Capitol on January 6, an attack on the seat of democracy that led to Trump's unprecedented second impeachment. The platform is referring the decision to its independent oversight board, which is tasked with making final decisions on appeals regarding what is removed or allowed to remain on the world's biggest social network. ""We believe our decision was necessary and right,"" Facebook vice president of global affairs Nick Clegg said in a blog post at the time. Members of the oversight board come from various countries and include jurists, human rights activists, journalists, a Nobel peace laureate and a former Danish prime minister. Launch of the panel came late last year amid rising concerns about misinformation and manipulation around the US election. Reaction to the Trump ban has ranged from criticism that Facebook should have booted him long ago to outrage over his online voice being muted. Zuckerberg said the decision to dial down politics related recommendations stemmed from user feedback, and will apply globally to the social network. ""We want these discussions to be able to keep happening,"" Zuckerberg said. ""But one of the top pieces of feedback that we are hearing from our community right now is that people don't want politics and fighting to take over their experience on our services."" —Agence France-Presse"
1,"Former Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano on Wednesday questioned the timing of the Charter change (Cha-cha) deliberations at the House of Representatives, saying that anything not related to the COVID-19 pandemic should be set aside. Cayetano made the remark as the House Committee on Constitutional Amendments resumed its deliberations on Resolution of Both Houses (RBH) No. 2, which seeks to propose amendments to the ""restrictive"" economic provisions in the Constitution. In an interview with reporters in Albay, Cayetano said that while he believes amendments should be introduced to the 1987 Constitution, it may not be the proper time to do so. ""Ako naniniwala na dapat amyendahan. Ang timing ang kwinekwestyon ko,"" he said. ""Anything na walang kaugnayan sa pandemic, isantabi muna natin,"" he added. For Cayetano, Cha-cha is a political issue that the government should not be focusing on in the middle of the ongoing pandemic. ""It’s a human question for us Filipinos. Do we want to focus on the vaccine or the pandemic or gusto ba natin mamulitika? Kasi pulitika tala yang Cha-cha na yan,"" he said. RBH No. 2 inserts the phrase ""unless otherwise provided by law"" to the constitutional provisions on national patrimony and economy; education, science and technology, arts, culture, and sports; and on general provisions to give Congress flexibility to enact laws that would free up the economy to foreign investors. Contrary to Cayetano's claim, House Committee on Constitutional Amendments chair Alfredo Garbin Jr. said the aim in introducing amendments to the ""restrictive"" economic provisions is, in fact, to help the country's economy to recover amid the global health crisis. He said the slight change in the Constitution's language ""will improve the investment climate and generate much needed investments and jobs to counteract the economic contraction caused by the pandemic."" He also maintained that the proposed amendments will focus only on the economic provisions, and no political amendments will be discussed in the hearings. —LDF, GMA News"
