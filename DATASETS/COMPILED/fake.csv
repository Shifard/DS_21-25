Beyond the cities, Duterte waged war on farmers and peasant leaders, overseeing the killings of 442 activists, 336 of them farmers,” the video said, as Duterte supposedly “earned the title ‘Massacre King’ for orchestrating mass killings in the countryside.” It also showcased several orders Duterte made during his presidency, framing his “reign” as a “a period of systematic political repression silencing anyone who dared to resist.” “His arrest isn’t just about him, it’s about justice for his victims. Unlike the thousands he had murdered, he is getting due process. But the fight isn’t over. The people must reject all efforts to whitewash his crimes and ensure that he, and every enabler of his bloody rule, faces full accountability. Duterte must be convicted,” James supposedly said."

In a separate statement, Kontra Daya said Celiz’s claims were “grounded in a falsehood that has been refuted not only by our group but also by reputable news media organizations, the courts and even the Commission on Elections.” “Even at the risk of stating the obvious, Kontra Daya is not a CPP project. Formed in 2007 after the ‘Hello Garci’ electoral fraud controversy under former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, Kontra Daya is a non-partisan election watchdog that focuses on the vulnerabilities of the electoral process and exposes corruption and electoral fraud,” it said."
