These posts, titled “Author of free college?”, contains portraits of Aquino labelled as “Author” and Duterte as “Signatory.” The posts also included a lengthy caption, urging netizens to conduct their research and recognize the efforts of Duterte. However, the sources cited by the posts are either inaccessible or links to online commerce platforms. Duterte did not mention the free college tuition bill  as a priority bill in his2017 State of the Nation Address(SONA). He only expressed his support for six proposed bills at the time: Former senator Ralph Recto is theprimaryauthor while Senator-elect Bam Aquino is the co-author and principal sponsor ofRA 10931.

The post featured a graphic that showed a photo of the mothers and wives of drug war victims, taken during a March 12 press conference, which falsely implied that they were ICC witnesses who had withdrawn. The case remains in its pre-trial stage,during which the three pre-trial judges are tasked with confirming the suspect’s identity and ensuring they fully understood the charges against them. The photo was taken during a press conference hosted by the human rights group Karapatan, held a day after the former president’s arrest to commemorate victims of the drug war—an issue that persists under the Marcos administration. There has beenno announcement from the ICCregarding any witness withdrawal, and even if such withdrawals were to occur, they would not automatically result in the dismissal of a case, contrary to what the post suggestedbased on prior proceedings.

A spliced clip from adocumentaryof GMA’s “Reporter’s Notebook” has circulated on TikTok, showing arrested drug suspect Renato “Nono” Loveras accusing Kian of being a “drug runner.” In the clip, Loveras claimed he received illegal drugs from the 17-year-old as a courier of a supplier named “Neneng.” This was the sole basis the Caloocan City police used to justify their anti-illegal drug operation against Kian during the “One Time, Big Time” operations in 2017. The edited videos online either showed overlay text labeling Kian as a drug runner or featured user commentary accusing him of being a drug pusher, taking Loveras’ account alone as truth. Loveras’ claims, which can be viewed from8:10 to 8:22 markof the documentary, were not acknowledged during the 2017 Senate probe into Kian’s killing nor by the Caloocan Regional Trial Court that handled the murder case in 2018, due to the weak evidence presented by the police. Former Caloocan City Police Chief Chito Bersaluna, who was also dismissed, testified before the Senate on Aug. 24, 2017, saying they verified Loveras’ claim through social media. It, however, turned out to includeseveral fake Facebook accountsthat also alleged Kian was a known drug user in Caloocan City. At the same hearing, the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) said its probe found that Loveras had lied and that his arrest was “stagedto conceal the crime” committed by the police officers. Kian’s family, friends and neighbors also vouched for Kian’s innocence. A wave of posts with a similar narrative of downplaying the experiences of drug war victims’ families and discrediting the victims themselves has been spreading online since mid-March. It started around the time Duterte was arrested on March 11 over crimes against humanity charges by the International Criminal Court (ICC). Read the full story onPhilstar.com.

The video has a sticker that says the Marcoses have “1.4 trillion + $.” The claim that the ex-president Ferdinand Marcos had $987 billion has beendebunked. Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, only has a net worth of $219 billion. The P200 billion figure tied to the Marcos name is, meanwhile, from theestate tax liabilitiesthat the family owes the government. Rep. Lito Atienza recalled that then-first lady Imelda Marcos once confided in him that she had 7,000 tons of gold, which she wanted to return to the government to pay off the nation’s debt.

The fact-checking organization also said that experts in an Inquirer storyexplainedthat Mrs. Marcos’ claim was unbelievable, as even 4,000 tons of gold would outnumber South Africa’ 10-year production, more than half of the gold reserves in Fort Knox in the U.S., and all of the reserves of the German Central Bank.

0,"Ayon sa isang Facebook post, mapapababa umano ng oil deal sa pagitan ni Presumptive President Bongbong Marcos at Russia ang presyo ng gasolina sa Pilipinas.Ito ay kulang sa konteksto. Hindi lamang pag-import ng supply ng langis ang nagpapasya sa presyo ng gasolina. Malaking factor ang TRAIN Law ng administrasyong Duterte, digmaang Ukraine at Russia, at global oil market na nagdidikta ng presyo ng langis. TRAIN Law at presyo ng langisBukod sa digmaan,malaking factor ang buwisna ipinapataw sa langis na nagpapasya sa presyo nito. Noong Disyembre 2017,nilagdaan ni Pangulong Rodrigo DuterteangRepublic Act 10963o mas kilala sa pangalang Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN). Nagpataw ito ng dagdag na buwis sa petrolyo at iba pang sources ng fuel kada litro. Sa isang fact-sheet, sinigurado ng Department of Finance nahindi lubos na tataas ang presyo ng pamasaheat bilihin bunga ng TRAIN law. Sa pamamagitan ng batas, may kapangyarihan ang DOF napigilan ang pagtaas ng presyo ng petrolyokung ito ay lalagpas sa $80 kada barrel. Ang kasalukuyang presyo ng krudo ay nasa $109.28 ngayong Hunyo 20. Deciding factors ng presyo ng gasolinaSamu’t sari ang mga kadahilanan na nagpapasya ng presyo ng gasolina, hindi lamang sa lokal na merkado ng Pilipinas, kundi sa buong daigdig na rin. Apektado ng factors na pumapalibot sa global oil market ang lokal na presyo ng krudong langis. Mayroongapat na pangunahing factorsna nagdidikta ng presyo nito: supply at demand, gastos sa produksyon, market sentiment, atgeopolitical events. Ayon sa law ofsupply and demand, habang tumataas ang demand para sa langis o nababawasan ang supply nito, tumataas ang presyo; kapag naman tumaas ang supply, o nababawasan ang demand, bumababa ang presyo nito. Bago ito ibenta sa mga gasolinahan, dumadaan muna ang langis saproseso ng produksyon. Dumadagdag din ito sa pangkabuuang presyo ng retail na gasolina. Apektado ng international factors ang presyo ng langis sa lokal na merkadoayon sa Department of Energy, at dahil dito ay nagkakaroon ng palagiang price adjustments sa retail price ng gasolina. Marcos-Russia oil dealAyon sa isang Wall Street Journal report, aminado si Russian President Vladimir Putin na apektado ang ekonomiya ng Russia sa mga sanction kontra sa kanilang tangkang pagsakop sa Ukraine, at magsasagawa ito ngreorientation mula Europa patungong Asyasa pagbenta sa krudo at gasolina. Noong Hunyo 13, tinagpo ni President-elect Marcos si Russian Ambassador to the Philippines Marat Pavlov. Pinag-usapan ng mga ito ang tatalakaying‘pagtulong’ at ‘cooperation’ ng Russia sa Pilipinassa panibagong source ng enerhiya, kabilang ang krudo. Ayon sa Economic Times, ito ay hakbang ng Russia buhat ng pangangailangan nitong maghanap ng mgamag-i-import ng kanilang energy resources.

The in-video caption alleges that Aquino’s primary intention in returning to the Philippines is to supplant the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos following the latter’s deteriorating health condition. The spliced video, however, was published cunningly, cutting off the context of the recorded conversation. While Ninoy Aquino used the words ‘trump cards’, it was not meant that he wanted to become Marcos’ successor. The full version of the conversation can be heard here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DMeZwC5oZY During the Marcos regime, anybody could get into serious trouble for expressing dissent against the government and its policies. The former senator knew that he will be sent directly to prison once he arrives in the Philippines. However, there are leverages – or trump cards – that Aquino could use to make the Marcoses treat him right. These are the following: 1. Then Prime Minister of Japan Yasuhiro Nakasone would continue providing economic assistance to the financially-ailing Philippines; and, 2. Nur Misuari would continue talks with the government if Ninoy Aquino would act as the negotiator. Aquino was seeking a dialogue with the terminally-ill Marcos hoping to persuade him to pave way for a peaceful and democratic transition of power through an election.

0,"Ayon sa isang Facebook post, makakapagpababa raw sa presyo ng kuryente ng bawat Pilipino ang pagbubukas ng Bataan Nuclear Power Plant (BNPP). Ito ay misleading sapagkat hindi kayang suplayan ng BNPP ng kuryente ang buong Pilipinas. Ano nga ba ang kapasidad ng Bataan Nuclear Power Plant?Taliwas sa kumakalat sa social media, hindi kayang suplayan ng BNPP ng kuryente ang buong bansa. Kung sakaling mabuksan ang plantang nukleyar, ito ay may kakayahan lang na mag-generate ng 620 MWe, sapat upangmag-supply ng kuryente sa 1.1%ng ating populasyon. Tunay namang mas bababa ang presyo ng kuryente kung ito ay magmumula sa mga nuclear plants.Ayon sa Power Philippines, kung magbubukas ang BNPP ay bababa sa ₱2 per kWh ang presyo ng kuryente para sa mga nasa grid nito, hamak na mas mababa sa kuryenteng mula sa coal-fired power plants na nagkakahalaga ng ₱6 per kWh. Ngunit bakit nga ba ipinasara ang Bataan Nuclear Power Plant?Nang dahil sasafety concernspatungkol sa mga lindol at sa kawalan ng pondo, hindi kailanman nagamit ang BNPP. Nang mangyari angpagsabog ngChernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, minarapat ni dating Pangulong Cory Aquino na i-”mothball” ang BNPP–hindi gagamitin ngunit aalagaan at pananatilihin ito sa magandang kondisyon hanggang maging handa ang Pilipinas sa pagbubukas o pagdi-dispose nito. Ang BNPP ay sangkot din sa samu’t-saring isyu ng korapsyon. Nakatanggap daw ang dating Pangulong Marcos ng$80 million na kickbackmula sa Westinghouse na developer ng BNPP. Sa isang desisyon ng Korte Suprema, inutusan nito ang datingMarcos crony na si Herminio Disini na magbayad ng ₱1.1Bna damages sa Republika ng Pilipinas kaugnay ng anomalya na nakapalibot sa BNPP.

In a separate statement, Kontra Daya said Celiz’s claims were “grounded in a falsehood that has been refuted not only by our group but also by reputable news media organizations, the courts and even the Commission on Elections.” “Even at the risk of stating the obvious, Kontra Daya is not a CPP project.

In the satirical “quote” card, “Queen Elizabeth” also “commented” that oligarchs were out to sabotage Marcos’ name, and that citizens kept on complaining. She then added that the Philippines did not have the “worse (sic) governance,” but the “worst citizens.” On the upper right hand corner can be seen a watermark of a logo of controversial vlogger Thinking Pinoy.

The poll body made this claim despite controversies surrounding the elections, prominent of which were VCM breakdowns, widespread disinformation, voter disenfranchisement, and vote-buying cases running into thousands of pesos per voter (Panganiban, 2022; PCIJ, 2022). Almost 50% of complaints validated by Vote Report PH were for VCM errors during election day (Vote Report PH, 2022). Aside from VCM errors, other issues that plagued the May 9 elections were missing names, long lines, illegal campaigning and red-tagging (De Leon, 2022a; De Leon, 2022b; Fernandez, 2022; Gavilan, 2022; Pazzibugan & Santos, 2022). Despite the secretive nature of vote-buying, Vote Report PH was still able to validate reports of vote-buying in selected regions of Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.

0,"The Facts: In a post by a Facebook user, a publication material was allegedly released by officials of Marikina Science High School claiming that their students have been invited to attend an “election-related movement.” In the pubmat, MariSci asserted that the school remains politically neutral and advised against participating in any such activities. The original Facebook poster claimed that this was the work of “NPA-backed Pinklawans,” who are trying to recruit non-voting minors. In the same post, he indicated that the source of the pubmat is from his brother’s PTA group chat. The Facebook user’s claim is false. Firstly, MariSci’s statement does not divulge which political group reached out to their students in the supposed election-related movement. The date of this announcement’s release is also unverifiable, as it only allegedly circulated within the PTA group chat during an unspecified time. Thus, this also calls into question the authenticity of the pub-mat itself. Furthermore, VP Robredo and her camp have no links to the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and their military arm, the New People’s Army (NPA), a fact that has been corroborated by the CPP previously. This has been reiterated multiple times (https://www.philstar.com/…/cpp-no-coalition-govt-talks…) (https://www.facebook.com/…/a.18748…/5249699091788986/…). Although on-ground Leni-Kiko campaigns in Marikina City are open to volunteers regardless of age, there have been no official reports that can verify that these ‘invitations’ are indeed done by Kakampinks to oblige MariSci students to participate in election-related events. Currently, there is no such public release made by Marikina Science High School on their official Facebook page regarding this alleged incident concerning their students.

0,"As millions of Filipinos thronged polling stations to elect a new president, social media posts shared purported documents from the Philippine election agency alongside a claim that one senatorial candidate and five minor political parties were disqualified for alleged communist links. But the documents featured in the posts are fake, according to the election agency. There was no record of the purported disqualification notice on the election agency’s websites. People wearing masks formed long queues before dawn on May 9 to cast their votes for president and national and local officials when polling stations opened across the archipelago, AFP reported. Screenshots of purported disqualification notices from Philippine election agency Comelec were shared on Facebook here one day earlier. One set of screenshots appears to show a resolution granting a disqualification petition filed by “Angela O. Aguilar” against senatorial candidate Neri Colmenares and five parties vying for seats in Congress. The screenshots say Colmenares and five party-list groups — BAYAN MUNA, Anakpawis, Kabataan, ACT Teachers and Gabriela Women’s Party — were “involved in the funding” of a communist rebel group and were disqualified from running for office. In the Philippines, the party-list system seeks to give citizens from marginalized groups representation in Congress.

0,"CONTEXT: Amid numerous reports on social media of vote-counting machines breaking down, there have been calls on social media that only the voter has the right to feed their ballot into the vote-counting machine. This is due to various reports stating that members of the election board have been requesting voters affected by breakdowns to leave their ballots behind and sign a waiver for their right to receive a voting receipt, as the election board will be responsible for feeding the ballots in the replacement voting machine later on. Under COMELEC resolution 10759 (2022), while the ballot should only be seen by the voter in most cases, other election officials can handle the ballot under contingency measures. Notably, when a vote counting machine breaks down, voters can opt to either wait for a vote counting machine to arrive and feed the ballot in themselves; or allow the election board official to feed the ballot later on when the replacement machine arrives. If they opt for the latter, then they should sign a waiver to this effect. If replacement machines are unavailable, the election board will be responsible for feeding the ballot while they find other machines that have already completed transmission. The ballots to be fed must be stored in a designated envelope. The process of feeding the ballots by the electoral board must be accompanied by poll watchers. Despite these contingency measures, voters are still encouraged to wait for replacement VCMs to arrive in order to be assured that their votes are counted correctly. The procedures laid out by COMELEC in case of contingencies allow ballot switching or other cases of vote manipulation if done incorrectly. Read the full story onKontra-Daya.

Gwen Garcia has issued an executive order banning large crowds of people in Cebu until June 2022 to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The “announcement” came from the satire page “Cebu Dairy News” on April 21, apparently meant to draw laughs from its followers. In the satirical “JUST IN” “news” item, the humor page reported Garcia’s draconian reaction after Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo’s rally in Mandaue drew 250,000 people. Garcia had endorsed Robredo’s rival, former senator Ferdinand Marcos Jr. But the satire post drew the ire of Garcia, who posted the following day a screenshot of the post with the words “FAKE NEWS” superimposed.

0,"Two Facebook (FB) pages and a netizen are circulating a photo – showing Vice President Leni Robredo and officials from the Commission on Elections (Comelec), among others – with false context. The April 18 posts used a photooriginally tweetedby Robredo’s eldest daughter Aika the day before, implying that the image shows the vice president and the polling body in a meeting to plan an election fraud scheme. It is wrong and baseless. Paulo Espiritu, the Office of the Vice President’s head of media relations, said in a Viber message that no such meeting transpired between Robredo and Comelec. Lawyer Barry Gutierrez, Robredo’s spokesperson, debunked the posts and said in another Viber message to VERA Files Fact Check that the photo was taken during the pre-debate briefing of the presidential contenders on April 3, when Comelec held its second presidential debate.

The survey included in the post dates the information to Pulse Asia’s February surveys (https://www.pulseasia.ph/february-2022-nationwide-survey…/), which do not mention any mayoral respondents and are instead from a random sampling of the general population.

Dagdag pa niya, tugma raw ito sa nag-viral na screenshot kung saan pinapagdala lamang ng coordinator ang mga dadalo ng pink flags bukod sa pagbabayad umano sa kanila.Ito ay hindi totoo at una nang itinanggi ng nasabing “coordinator”. “I have confirmed this from a friend who organized campaigns for two cities: they are asked to only carry pink flags, balloons, and placards… any pink paraphernalia… and are specifically asked to NOT carry the Philippine flag. It corroborates that viral leaked private convo between someone and a (probably national) coordinator that they’re asking local coordinators to  tell people to only carry pink flags. Aside from the alleged payment per attendance of course.” Nang siyasatin, walang anumang ibinigay na source ang nag-post ng viral FB post sa sinasabi nitong “leaked private convo” sa pagitan ng isang “national coordinator” at “local coordinator.” Matatandaan na una na ring naglabas ng pahayag ang Lawyers for Leni na walang katotohanan sa viral screenshot na dinadawit sila bilang ang naturang “coordinator” na nagbabayad umano sa mga dumalo at nagbabawal sa pagdadala ng Philippine flags sa mga rally ni Robredo.

This is False. The Facts: The CPP-NPA-NDF does indeed have a Catholic arm called the Christians for National Liberation (CNL), but even in the archives of the CPP and the CNL (https://cpp.ph/authors/christians-for-national-liberation/) there is not a single statement of support for Robredo, nor even any political candidate. Neither has the CPP-NPA-NDF declared support for any candidate. The CEAP meanwhile has categorically and repeatedly denied any ties to the CPP-NPA-NDF (https://www.philstar.com/…/esperon-hits-reds-ceap…), but even then they have been called members of the communist terrorist element by the NTF-ELCAC and Parlade in the past.

The posts circulated online in the lead-up to the May presidential elections where Robredo trails the son and namesake of the country’s former dictator. But the video shared in the posts — which gained tens of thousands of views — had been misleadingly edited. The Philippine Supreme Court in 2021 dismissed Marcos Jr’s poll fraud case against Robredo for “lack of merit”. Read the full story onAFP Fact Check.

Quiboloy, who claims to be the “Appointed Son of God” and the “Owner of the Universe”. The quote card claims Quiboloy was honored to proclaim the son and namesake of the late dictator and plunderer to become a saint of his Kingdom of Jesus Christ Church because Marcos Jr. possessed the qualities shown by God.

The Bangui Wind Farm, which is the first power-generating windmill farm in Southeast Asia, was developed by NorthWind Power Development Corp (https://manilastandard.net/…/ilocos-norte-s-windmills…).

The basis of developing said wind farm was spurred by a 1996 study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), which tagged certain areas in the Philippines as ideal for wind farming, and the units themselves were supplied by Vestas Wind Systems from Denmark. Neither has Marcos had a direct hand in the development of the other two wind farms in Ilocos. Read the full story onThe Baguio Chronicle.

It gouged out the other side to upend the story but to take a free ride from the Rappler article to give it “legitimacy.” Unsurprisingly, the video producer, Viral Philippines (@Bayral.Philippines) is unabashedly pro-Ferdinand Marcos Jr. But back to the original article supposedly cited in the video. It says that the OVP has since not only pledged a review of the guidelines for selecting LGUs to assist, but also that the OVP has since clarified the selection process after the COA’s initial comments in the audit report.

This is false.No fact-checking organization rated his statement during the CNN presidential debate as accurate, withPhilstar.com, Rappler and TV5 all rating it as false.In a separate fact-check, ABS-CBN also debunked Montemayor’s claim and provided context on the donation of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to the city of Manila.Based on the foundation’s website, it committed $319,147 (almost P16 million) to the local government to “procure and demonstrate innovative, safe, off-grid toilet products and utility services in low-income communities that are not safely reachable by incumbent toilet technologies or utility services.”"

Panfilo Lacson with 1% each. A closer look at the infographic, however, showed that the Bulletin’s social media team combined two separate polls in a single pie chart to arrive at its supposed results. With Twitter polls limited to a maximum of four options, the newspaper had to resort to using two separate polls to accommodate the six candidates included in its survey.

0,"A nearly three-year-old Facebook post against the Aquino family is being revived online, making allegations that are either erroneous, baseless or which need context. Originally published on Jan. 9, 2019, the post stated that: We fact-checked each claim below. This claim is unproven.Hermes Dorado, former national territory division head of the Department of Foreign Affairs,claimed in 2013that Aquino met with then-Malaysian Prime Minister Mohammad Mahathir. In thesupposed meeting, which allegedly took place before Aquino returned to the Philippines from self-exile in the United States, the former senator told Mahathir that he would drop the Philippines’ claim on Sabah once in power, in exchange for Malaysia’s support to oust Marcos. Aquino was assassinated on his return on Aug. 21, 1983. Dorado said he indirectly confirmed this piece of information from former ambassador and retired general Rafael Ileto. This claim could not be verified by documents or other accounts. Read the full story onVERA Files Fact Check.

The image — shared after Robredo launched her presidential bid for 2022 — prompted accusations from some social media users that she staged the stunt in order to “court votes”. But the image has been digitally altered; Robredo’s head has been inserted on the body of a Filipino seafood stallholder originally pictured by a Philippine broadcaster in 2019.

0,"President Rodrigo Duterte’s claim that the improvement of the air and sea ports in General Santos City (GenSan) is part of his centerpiece “Build, Build, Build” infrastructure program is false. The upgrading of the city’s airport and the Makar Wharf was funded and started during the term of the late President Benigno Simeon Aquino III (2010 to 2016). While those development projects were completed under the current Duterte administration, they were initiated during the previous Aquino administration. According to the SOCSKSARGEN Area Development Project Office (SADPO) Annual Report 2015, the General Santos City Airport was provided a budget of P959 million under Calendar Year 2015 of the Department of Transportation and Communications’ (DOTC) Infrastructure Program for the improvement of the existing airport passenger terminal building and other facilities.
