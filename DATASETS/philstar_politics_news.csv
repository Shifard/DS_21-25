1,"HINDI lang ito panukalang batas. Isa itong matapang na pani­nindigan laban sa sistemang matagal nang sumasakal sa demokrasya ng Pilipinas. Ang pagsusulong ni Sen. Robin Padilla ng Resolution of Both Houses No. 9 ay tila isang ma­tulis na sibat na ngayon pa lamang ay binabatikos na ng mga naghaharing angkan na ayaw pakawalan ang kapangyarihan. Isang katotohanan na halos hindi na maitatanggi, 70 per­cent ng mga mambabatas ay mula sa mga pamilyang pulitikal. Sa bawat halalan, iisa ang apelyidong paulit-ulit. Palit-palit lang ng puwesto: mayor ngayon, governor bukas, congress­man sa susunod, tapos asawa o anak ang susunod sa trono. Ang ipinapanukalang amyenda sa Konstitusyon ay simpleng prinsipyo ng katarungan: Ang pamahalaan ay hindi dapat maging family corporation. Ang serbisyo publiko ay para sa lahat ng mamamayan hindi lamang para sa mga pamilyang may pangalan, yaman, at impluwensiya. Hindi ito laban sa mga taong may kakayahan na nagka­taong kamag-anak ng mga opisyal. Ito ay laban sa sistemang ginawang negosyo ang pulitika. Kapag pinayagan nating ma­mayagpag ang dinastiyang pulitikal, hinahayaan nating ma­bulok ang haligi ng demokrasya: ang pantay-pantay na pagkakataon para sa bawat Pilipino. Kung ang intensyon ni Padilla ay tunay at walang bahid ng pansariling interes, ito ay isang hakbang na dapat purihin. Ngunit hindi rin dapat tayo bulag. Ang mga ganitong panu­kala ay hindi magtatagumpay kung walang tunay na suporta mula sa taumbayan. Ang problema ay hindi lang batas kundi ang kultura ng takot at pagkakampi-kampi na nakaugat sa pulitika. Kailangan nating gisingin ang bayan sa katotohanang ang kapangyarihang hindi napapalitan ay kapangyarihang inaabuso. Kung hindi natin sisimulan ngayon, kailan pa?

1,"The journey to excellence is long and winding, cultivated through a combination of knowledge, honed skills, and extensive training. Achieving mastery requires dedication and a commitment to continuous learning, and so for some who have attained high levels of expertise for they have invested significant time and effort into their craft. They are professionals who have consistently worked to refine their abilities. Their journey reflects a persistent pursuit of improvement and a willingness to embrace challenges. The culmination of this journey is the attainment of experience and proficiency. But how can excellence be of great essence? We always uphold excellence as a core value, believing it to be the key to standing out from others. It is through excellence that we distinguish ourselves and demonstrate our commitment to quality. Our pursuit of high standards acts as a magnet, attracting others seeking knowledge and support. By consistently striving for excellence, we inspire trust and confidence within our community. This dedication not only elevates our work but also encourages others to follow our example. Excellence is the foundation that strengthens our reputation and fosters a culture of continuous improvement. Our legislators, more specifically, some of them have graduated from reputable academic institutions and have established their names in politics and public service. These achievements reflect their dedication and expertise, yet true value of excellence is often tested in moments of challenge. When such times arise, it is honor that truly sets them apart and defines their character. Honor acts as the distinguishing mark that elevates a person's integrity beyond skills and accomplishments. It is in these decisive moments that the true strength of their leadership is revealed. While excellence commands recognition, it is honor that cements one’s legacy. Excellence may bring accolades and praise in the moment, but honor ensures that one's deeds are remembered with respect and integrity over time. Honor reflects the moral character and principles that guide actions, giving lasting meaning to achievements. It is through honor that individuals earn the trust and admiration of others beyond mere success. A legacy built on both excellence and honor endures, inspiring future generations to uphold the same values. It is indeed frustrating to recognize that when someone is truly excellent but fails to use that talent for the good of others, their abilities become meaningless. Excellence without purpose or moral integrity can lead to wasted potential and missed opportunities for positive impact. True value lies not only in personal achievement but also in how one contributes to the well-being of others. When excellence is directed towards self-serving motives instead of service, its significance diminishes greatly. It is the responsible and altruistic use of one’s gifts that gives excellence its true purpose and lasting meaning. The fusion of excellence and honor represents the pinnacle of human endeavor. It underscores not just the pursuit of exceptional results, but also the unwavering commitment to ethical conduct in their attainment. To strive for peak performance while maintaining integrity is not merely a strategy; it's a testament to character and a path to enduring success."
1,"Comes now the triumvirate of Bam, Kiko and Risa in the Senate, backed up by the likes of Leni Robredo, Leila de Lima and Chel Diokno, Vico Sotto of Pasig, Joy Belmonte of QC, Benjie Magalong of Baguio, Kaka Bag-ao of Dinagat and, yes, of course, Pam Baricuatro of Cebu. Then let's scout for a few stout-hearted men and women, here and there, all coming together?  Should we not look at them as our new hopes for the Philippines in 2028, and onward? Our new knights in shining armors fighting like Don Quixote de la Mancha, aided by Sancho Panchas. I look at my former UST law student, Congressman Lorenz Defensor of Iloilo, so young, so idealistic and so unfettered by corruption and ineptitude. This nation should now be sick and tired of trapos and dynasties. The people have already rejected the likes of Cynthia Villar and Gwen Garcia. The voters have already said a big “No” to such characters as Willy Revillame and Manny Pacquiao, Bong Revilla and Philip Salvador. Good job. Let us maximize the force of momentum. We should explore the best options. Let us look for the new versions of Raul Manglapus and Ninoy Aquino and usher in a new political renaissance. Why should we, Filipinos, be compelled to choose only between Marcos and Duterte? Why are we limiting our options? Led by the youth and the middle class idealists, the civil society and the business sector, the church and the NGOs, should we not be seeing the emergence of a new ""breath of fresh air inside a catacomb of stench and decay""? Should we not start to contemplate Risa, Bam and Kiko? Imagine a government after 2028 led by these conscientious officials. To the untarnished names of senators Risa Hontiveros, Bam Aquino and Kiko Pangilinan, let us add the names of Leni Robredo, Leila de Lima, Chel Diokno and Vico Sotto and Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong. They can get the support of Koko Pimentel who lost his congressional bid in Marikina. I hope they can recruit from Cebu such shining names as Samsam Gullas of the first district, Gungun Gica of the seventh district and Shun Shimura of the fourth district and the incoming Cebu Governor, Pam Baricuatro, as well as Cebu City Mayor Nestor Archival. There are many others, like Sol Aragones of Laguna and Daniel Fernando in Bulacan. The nation should not be compelled to choose only between two undesirable extreme choices: the BBM-led inept, ineffective and underperforming administration, on the one hand, and the Duterte-led group of highly questionable characters with tarnished reputation, tainted with the impeachment of the vice president and the human rights records of the past president. It is high time to look at a third and better option, with track record of excellent performance, unimpeachable character and proven pro-people, pro-poor advocacies. They are not members of family dynasties. They are the best for the people. The Senate is about to witness a skirmish between on one side, the Malacanang-allied, team led by incumbent Senate President Chiz Escudero, who should be collaborating with incoming senator and former senate president Tito Sotto and Ping Lacson, and on the other side, the Duterte team composed of Senators Bong Go, Bato de la Rosa, Rodante Marcoleta, Imee Marcos, Camille Villar in addition to Robinhood Padilla. Based on their pronouncements, the Duterte team will most probably be joined by the Cayetano siblings: senators Alan Peter and Pia, and also Senator Mark Villar. That means 10 for the Dutertes. The Escudero-Sotto alliance should court Loren Legarda and the Estrada/Ejercito brothers, Migz Zubiri, as well as the Tulfo brothers, Grace Poe, Joel Villanueva and Win Gatchalian. The Senate is becoming a family affair: Villar siblings, Cayetano brother and sister, Estrada/Ejercito half-brothers, and the Tulfos. It would appear from the looks of it that the Dutertes have a better chance to capture the Senate presidency. That means the impeachment of VP Sara is a lost cause for the BBM administration. The debacles that the BBM Senate slate suffered in the last midterm polls will make it difficult for Chiz to retain his seat and for Tito Sen to win that seat if he does not play games with the Duterte team. The third force composed of Senators Risa, Bam and Kiko will play a crucial role and I think this triumvirate will most probably either inhibit or join the team of Chiz and Tito rather than join Robinhood Padilla and Rodante Marcoleta. These three should get major concessions from the incoming Senate president by cornering the Blue Ribbon Committee and a membership of the Appropriations Committee, Commission on Appointments, Senate Electoral Tribunal and the Judicial and Bar Council which plays a vital role in the appointment of Justices, judges, the Ombudsman and the Constitutional Commissions. As a concerned member of civil society and of the press, I would love to see either Risa or Bam running for president in 2028, or Kiko and Leni again. I would be very happy if and when in 2028, the Filipino voters shall not be limited to the choice between Martin Romualdez and Sara Duterte with Raffy Tulfo as a dark horse. I would much prefer that the team of Bam/Risa/Kiko, augmented by Leni, Leila and Chel would give the traditional candidates a credible run for their money. And if their campaign should go well, they can even win the presidency. I think that the third force should be able to galvanize the youth votes. Considering that more than two-thirds of the electorate belongs to the age bracket of 18 to 40, the third force should consider the Gen Zs, the millennials and the other younger voters. This team should organize student symposia, link with school organizations and fraternities, sororities and student councils. This group should inherit the constituencies of the late senator Miriam Defensor Santiago. There is a student power and a youth power which only need younger leaders like Bam, Kiko and Risa to federate them. This nation has a better future away from Marcos and from the Dutertes. We need this third force which is still imbued with idealism and with an untarnished sense of decency, dignity and integrity. Let us push this momentum to greater heights and save our nation from the trapos schemes and machinations towards ultimate disaster and perdition. We can, we should and we will."
1,"MAY nagtanong sa akin: “Ano ang solusyon sa mga sulira­ning pulitikal ng ating bansa?” Sa pananaw ninyo, may ka­lutasan pa nga ba ang krisis pampulitikang dinaranas natin? Or has the situation become a vicious cycle na paikut-ikot na lang at walang katapusan? Sa bawat nagdaang administrasyon, naharap tayo sa sari-saring krisis ngunit wala na marahil titindi pa sa dinaranas natin ngayon. Bangayan ng dalawang malakas na puwersa sa pulitika. Wala akong nakikitang solusyon mula sa lohika at pana­naw ng tao, ngunit mayroon ang Diyos. Iyan ay kung haha­yaan natin Siya na mamagitan. Kaya lang, lubha nang nag­kawatak-watak ang kaisipan ng tao. Bawat isa ay may pina­niniwalaang solusyon sa suliranin at hindi sila ubrang magkaisa. Ang makasariling interes at kasakiman ng tao ay huma­hadlang sa Diyos na mamagitan. Natatakot ang lahat na mawalan ng pakinabang kung susunod tayo sa nais ng Diyos. Kung tutuusin, puwede namang ipatupad ng Diyos ang kanyang solusyon ngunit iginagalang Niya ang mala­yang kaisipan o free will ng tao. Hindi siya hahadlang sa ating mga desisyon ngunit haharapin natin ang konsekwensiya ng bawat maling pasya natin. Sa katunayan, pinagbabayaran ang mga maling desis­yong nagawa natin na resulta ng paglisan natin sa liwanag­ ng Diyos, at ang pinakamasama ay darating pa. Iyan ay kung hindi tayo magbabalik loob at yuyukod sa kalooban ng Panginoon."
1,"MAPAGKUMBABANG inamin ni President Bongbong Marcos na malaki ang naging pagkukulang niya kaya inilampaso ng mga kalaban ang mga kandidato ng Alyansa ng Bagong Pilipinas sa nakaraang eleksiyon. Akala kasi alkansya! Nagsawa na rin ang mamamayan sa lantarang pagkabulok sa sistema ng pulitika na manipulado ng mga pamilya ng ­mayayamang nambababoy sa pamumuhay ng mahihirap na pilipino. Ayaw sa reporma, pagnanakaw lang ang kursunada! Hindi mapasubalian na kaya ibinotong muli sa senado sina Tito Sotto, Ping Lacson, Kiko Pangilinan at Bam Aquino ay dahil nagtrabaho talaga sila ng totoo at wala silang record ng pandarambong sa kaban ng bayan. Lagot ang mga tamad at may record ng pandarambong na mga reelectionists sa 2028 kung ganun. Action Stars no more? Patunay din na pinagsasawaan na ng taumbayan ang barubalan sa social media na pakawala ng magkabilang kampo ng pulitika at itinuring na lamang na komedya at aliwan ng mga nababagot na mamamayan. Totoo naman ang komentaryo ng ilan, maliban lang sa nagmumula sa troll farms. Araykupu! Malamang na sa 2028 Presidential election ay hindi na magiging mahirap para sa mga botante ang pagpili ng susunod na Presidente. Ang may bahid ng pandarambong ay maari na ring mag-isip ng pagpapahinga. Kung marunong mahiya at may konsensiya! Handa rin daw makipagkasundo si Bongbong kay VP Sara sa kabila ng pagbabanta nito sa buhay niya at kanyang pamilya at impeachment proceedings sa Senado alang-alang sa ikabubuti ng buong bansa. Aba’y kakaiba nga si Bongbong talaga! Sa pamilya ng pulitikong nagmamaniobra ng party-list para manaid sa pondo ng bayan, lalong dumami ang palamuning sectoral representative “raw” sa kongreso. Tantanan na ninyo kaming nakalupasay na sa paghihirap. Baka magbara na ang daloy ng dugo sa inyong mga ugat dahil sa panghaharbat. Abolish party-lists, please!"
1,"CEBU, Philippines —  In a press conference yesterday, some residents of Dalaguete Town denied that the cases they filed against incumbent and reelectionist Mayor Ronald Allan Cesante were politically motivated, but said these are based on facts and evidence. The complainants urged the mayor to face the seven charges lodged against him, but not the town itself, devoid of any politics. “Miawhag kami ni Mayor Ronald Allan Cesante nga hunungon na ang pagpamakak ug pag pangilad sa mga Dalaguitnon. Atubangon niya ang mga kaso ug dili apilon ang pagpamolitika nini,” said the complainants. The complainants who signed their unified statement are Joname Ensenales, Mengred Ensenales Gegremosa, Jose Rene Moran, Ildebrando Almagro, Braulio Moran, and Mario Jacento. “Palihug usab pag-undang o hunong sa paggamit sa munisipyo tungod kay wala kini atraso dinhi kanamo. Ang tanang kaso nga imong giatubang personal nimo nga binuhatan ug dili sa munisipyo tungod sa interest o kaayuhan og dili sa lungsod,” the complainants added. Atty. Joey Borinaga, the lawyer of the complainants reiterated that there is nothing political about the cases they filed against the mayor since these were filed long before the campaign season. The seven cases filed by the complainants were for the approval utilization and construction of a warehouse on a privately-owned land despite having no deed of absolute sale and or authority from the owner, construction of a project, entitled construction of pre-fabricated warehouse, improper and lawful use of the resources and manpower of the municipality in connection with a project award by the DPWH to a private contractor, improper and unlawful use of the resources and manpower of the municipality in connection with a project awarded a private contractor which resulted in the death of one of the municipal job-order employee, among others. Earlier, Cesante said that the complainants are trying to paint a picture where the LGU is performing the job of DPWH. “That is a lie. The truth is, LGU Dalaguete has a project complete with proper documentation in the form of road concreting in the area. It is in segmented form due to funding concerns. DPWH also has a separate project connecting both roads. There is no overlap that occurred here. All appropriate documents and evidence including proper receipts are available for the public,” the mayor earlier said. (CEBU NEWS)"
1,"Confession is good for the soul. I heard these words as an opening statement from a politician, now retired, during a non-political forum many years ago. Former congressman Eduardo Rivera Gullas, addressing a graduation ceremony of the University of the Visayas College of Law, proceeded to speak how confession frees the conscience of a man of his guilt. Absolution, in a manner of speaking, restores man’s spirit freed from condemnation. Believe me, I thought Sir Eddiegul, in his exposition, was more of a bishop than a lawmaker. Well, maybe because he was then in his last term as a legislator after decades of government service. After his introductory line in that commencement exercise, the university president, shifted gears. He confessed not being a perfect leader but he wove profound principles and real governance in a stirring speech. Gullas explained to the graduating class the importance of serving the government with the strictest adherence to scruples. “Principled politics”, he called it as he praised his membership of the Nacionalista Party. He said politicians must adopt and uphold uncompromising principles in everything they do. Political ideals of elected leaders in government must NOT be wrapped in selfish interests. After all, public office is a public trust. I remember the sterling words of Sir Eddiegul when I saw, the other night, a disturbing political advertisement of senatorial candidate Camille Villar. I like to believe that the political clout of the Villar political dynasty was a reason Camille was included in BBM’s original lineup. She is the daughter of 2010 presidential candidate Manny Villar. Her mother, Senator Cynthia authored the regressive Rice Tariffication Law while brother Mark, after heading the DPWH, became senator too. No doubt, hers is s formidable political clout which BBM can rely on. To be sure, Villar was supposedly a part of the Alyansa Para Sa Bagong Pilipinas line up of BBM arrayed against the PDP of former president Rodrigo Duterte. The Nacionalista Party with Manny Villar, as its president, aligned with Alyansa. Camille was then announced a proxy of BBM in his war against Digong. By itself, the business empire of the Villars that makes the political family the richest in the country and the herculean network they have can support Camille’s electoral undertaking sans outside help. Yet they took the opportunity for Camille to ride on the imagined political strength of the administration. In fact, shouting “Alyansa 12-0” in the proclamation rally in Ilocos Norte, the president’s drumbeaters wanted to project that it would demolish the entire PDP. A political video the other day projected the unprincipled character of Camille. Without telling us, the voters, why she unceremoniously abandoned BBM’s Alyansa, she just flipped over to Duterte’s PDP. I was shocked to see her showing a clenched fist upon being endorsed in her candidacy by Vice President Sara Duterte Carpio. It was turncoatism at its worst. I surmise she is only after her selfish interest. When she saw in the nationwide rallies held during the birthday of former president Duterte the emergence of Digong supporters, she discarded whatever reasons bolted NP and Alyansa and became friendly with the enemy. I couldn’t imagine VP Sara ever inviting Camille to join PDP. The vice president had no reason to do that. She would not want to disrespect the principles of PDP by bringing in someone who was earlier perceived as a BBM diehard. Anyway, her PDP senatoriables were doing well in the campaign trail as a result of the growing nationwide sympathy for Digong. Having viewed the situation that way, I could only conclude that it was the Villars who proposed Camille jump over to PDP and for no other motivation than to preserve her fading candidacy. I know that Sir Eddiegul has, since 1969, been an adherent of the principles of Nacionalista Party. So, I also believe that he considers the switch of Camille to the opposite camp as an act of betrayal."
1,"MANILA, Philippines — Naging sandigan ng seguridad ng bansa si National Security Adviser Secretary Eduardo Año sa panahong hinaharap ng bansa ang samu’t saring banta mula sa tensyon sa pagitan ng China at Taiwan at maniobra sa local politics. Ayon sa National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC), bilang dating pinuno ng Hukbong Sandatahan ng Pilipinas at dating kalihim ng Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), dala ni Año ang malawak na karanasan sa larangan ng seguridad, intelihensiya, at pamumuno. Dala rin niya ang isang matatag na paninindigang inuuna ang kapakanan ng taumbayan at ng Republika, sa halip na pansariling interes o pulitikal na alyansa. Epektibong isinulong ni Año ang whole-of-nation approach upang mapanatili ang kalayaan at soberanya ng Pilipinas—habang iniiwasan ang direktang pagkakasangkot sa digmaan. Sa kanyang liderato, pinagtitibay ang ugnayan sa mga kaalyadong bansa at pinaigting ang moder­nisasyon ng seguridad sa ilalim ng panibagong national security policy."
1,"In the battle for public opinion especially in politics, part of the arsenal of astute politicians and their handlers is to “play the victim card”. In the Philippines, we have seen how government officials/politicians suddenly get sick, get medical certificates, or request for hospital detention when summoned or arrest is imminent. Sudden rise in blood pressure, blood sugar, and excessive stress are cited as reasons, as if these are not pre-existing conditions of most Filipinos. Some even wear neck braces and use wheelchairs. Playing the victim card (PTVC) is so well used in human behavior that it is now in Google and Wikipedia. Artificial Intelligence defines playing the victim as portraying one-self as wronged and unfairly treated, often to gain sympathy, avoid responsibility, or manipulate others, essentially exaggerating or fabricating victimhood. Google further explains that it involves presenting oneself as a victim, even when not truly wronged, to achieve a specific outcome or avoid accountability. In the International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest of Duterte, the initial pro-Duterte narrative and lingering now, is to play the victim card. In the videos of the arrest in the airport and in Camp Villamor, Bong Go and other supporters expressed explicit concern about Duterte’s health and his advanced age. There were also allegations of lack medical attention/facilities, lack of food, and mistreatment of the family. These were all refuted and the videos contradicted these assertions. It was a policewoman who was hurt by Duterte’s wife. The airport arrest, the departure by private jet to the Netherlands, and his arrival treatment in The Hague were all pleasant as covered by the media and shown in the videos. VP Sara even thanked the Philippine Embassy in the Netherlands for their services, and Duterte was examined in a hospital and declared physically and mentally fit before proceeding to the ICC detention facilities. The pictures of the ICC detention facilities are luxurious by prison standards, with air-conditioned/heated private rooms/bathrooms and sports facilities. Access to cellphones, computers, and television are allowed. Visitation rights and lawyers conferences are also allowed with prior approvals. Given all the realities of the arrest events up to the detention in the ICC facilities, PTVC did not and will not work. The more substantive reasons why PTVC will not work, is the gravity and the evidence of the human rights violations of Duterte. The charges are well documented and there are still living witnesses of the families of the victims, and even of the direct perpetrators like Lascañas and Matobato, who has and will testify against Duterte. On top of these, Duterte publicly admitted in many fora that he had ordered the EJKs and will take responsibility for them. Duterte’s aggressive character and verbal abuses doesn’t make him look like a victim. The Duterte defense strategists/tacticians have now downplayed the victim ploy/PTVC and shifted to the legality/propriety of the arrest with petitions to the Philippine Supreme Court and to the ICC. They have also mounted a massive public opinion propaganda campaign in social media on what he has done during his presidency. Social media is their main vehicle as the main media carries both the fake news and the validated news, and the BBM administration has been adept and quick in replying to all of the fake news and troll posts. There was already an initial hearing in the ICC last week to establish identity, physical and mental status of the accused, lay down trial procedures/schedules. The next hearing is on September this year to have enough time for the prosecution and defense teams to prepare. There is no way that the final outcome can be predicted, but as the proceedings will be internationally watched and seen, the judicial process and the fairness of the proceedings will be well appreciated. Truth and justice will prevail."
1,"PAMPAMILYA na ang galawan sa pulitika ng ating bansa. Pansariling kapakanan lamang at hindi ang pag-angat ng nakararami ang itinataguyod. Nakapanghihinayang ang talino ng ating mga kababayan na hindi nabibigyan ng puwang para makapagserbisyo sa bayan, dahil lamang sa kakapusan ng popularidad at budget. Mas ginugusto ng mga naghaharing pamilya sa pulitika ang makitang naghihirap ang naka­paligid sa kanila upang magmukha silang manunubos sa abang kalagayan ng kanilang nasasakupan. Unti-unting nilusaw ng pulitika ang pagiging malikhain ng isang Pilipino dahil pilit na ibi­nabaling ng mga pulitiko na sila lamang ang pag-asa ng taumbayan. Hindi nila ikinahihiya ang katotohanang ang lakas sa likod ng kanilang tagumpay ay binili lamang. Ang pagsasalin ng liderato sa kaanak ay epektibo sa lokal na pamahalaan lalo pa’t may patunay na umasenso ang pamayanan sa ilalim ng kanilang pamamahala, pero hindi naging patunay ito na epektibo silang maging senador o Presidente. May mga senador at kongresista tayong mga anak ng dating Presidente na kinulapol na ng isyu ng korapsiyon pero nananalo sa eleksyon. Nakasanayan na lang ng supporters nila na isiping nagbabawi lang ng ginastos sa eleksiyon ang idol nila. Nakakaparte naman daw sa ayuda. Utak bigas, noodles at delata? May ilang kumakandidato ngayong senador ang walang muwang sa pag-ugit ng batas o pruweba sa public service. Popularidad lamang sa showbiz ang puhunan na ang iba ay popular pa sa pagiging imoral. Komedya na talaga kapag nanalo pa sila. Iilan lamang ang katulad ni dating Quezon City Mayor at House Speaker Feliciano “SB” Belmonte Jr. Dahil sa kanya, umasenso ang QC na walang naiwang bahid ng katiwalian sa panunungkulan. Sayang na presidentiable si “SB”, di ba? Sa idaraos na candidates forum na may “debate”. Abangan natin kung sino ang senatoriables ang magmumukhang bulok na kamote!"
1,"Here come the liars again. Politics in the Philippines and even in many other countries, is the art of telling lies and being elected because of them. And the voters never seem to learn. Over and over again the people are taken in for a ride. This is a country of so many brilliant people who keep on electing jokers in both Houses of Congress. It is the season of blatant and shameless politics. And these are the worst of times, and with apologies to Charles Dickens, these can also become the best of times. The campaign period is upon us and the Philippines is going to be poisoned with lies, lies and unadulterated lies to manipulate the minds of the voters and confuse the people. Lie number one: Here is a young female candidate for senator whose mom cannot run for reelection due to term limits, and whose brother is the most silent among the members of the Senate, who is trying to mislead us that she is the voice of change, the voice of innovation, something fresh. My God, she is the most telling evidence of the status quo. She can never represent change. Her family business empire has been, for the longest time, transforming tenant's farms into housing projects, thereby exacerbating our food crisis and unrelenting rice importation. And her mom is the sitting chair of the committee of agriculture. Talk of conflict of interest, is she going to change that? Lie number two: another female senatorial candidate is misleading us again with her ""Make it Better"" slogan, alluding to doing better than her sister who cannot run for senator again for being term limited. Better than what? Reminds us of another half brothers from a nearby city one of whom called himself, The Good One. These families are lording over metro cities as anointed barons and baronesses of wealthy political dynasties. Why are the Filipino voters being made to umpire this petty sibling rivalry? This candidate for senator is the mayor of a business city and her own outgoing senator/sister is running for her post as mayor against her own husband. Changing chairs and perpetuating their control of the city where his dad, her mom and her brother used to be mayors too. My God, why are Filipino voters being made to arbitrate over their family feuds or perpetuate their dynasty? Lie number three; "" ""Kakampi ng Mga Inaapi."" Three brothers bearing the same family names, whose sister was a former cabinet member, are going to be sitting in the same Philippine Senate. They are noted for their radio and TV programs where public officials and career bureaucrats are scolded, humiliated and bullied even before they could open their mouths. These brothers are destroying the credibility of duly established institutions by castigating agencies based on the one-sided complaints from people who do not have the fairness to tell the other side of the truth. And now, they want to fight corruption after their own sister reportedly entered into a contract with a TV network that employed her own brother who allegedly benefitted from such a contract. Lie number four:"" Ang Bisyo ay Serbisyo."" My God, you guys are being paid, given millions of budget from the poor peoples' taxes, provided with staff, and if you do your job, you claim it as extraordinary. That is a lie. You are trying to portray yourself as above the ordinary trapo. You are closely aligned with someone being seriously suspected of so many heinous crimes by the ICC. Lie number five: I am running because the drug problem is up again and I want to protect the Filipino families. My God, this guy should be ashamed of himself. The truth is being unearthed. He just won because his boss was then very popular and anyone he endorsed was pushed to victory.  Now the people are all in deep regret. It is a crazy time again in the Philippines. There are a thousand and one lies up in the air, up in the giant tarpaulins, in radio and TV clips. If you are not careful, you can be manipulated. The power in your hand is that you have the gift of discernment, the gift of wisdom and the gift of choice. You can transform the worst of times into the best of times. You can choose to be bullied, fooled, hoodwinked or manipulated. Or, as Maria Ressa did, you can stand up to a dictator. You can stand up to a shameless liar.  Do not be manipulated by any liar and by any politician. Tell him or her: Shame on you."
1,"A lot of interesting events have happened for the first two weeks of February. As usual, political shenanigans have occupied us, this time the passing of the articles of impeachment against Vice President Sara Z. Duterte. At the center of this political drama is the Romualdez-Marcos family. Once again, this is resonant of the not so distant past, involving various players in families and politics. The Romualdezes and Marcoses are no strangers to three of the country's top four highest positions. Between the two clans, they have held the positions of president, senate president, and speaker. The first to do so was Daniel Zialcita Romualdez, who was speaker of the House of Representatives from 1958 to 1962. His father, Miguel Romualdez, was the uncle of Imelda Romualdez. In fact, it was Daniel who introduced his cousin to Ferdinand Marcos, who was a young legislator at that time. Of course, we know that Marcos soon became president, and served as dictator until being toppled from power in 1986. In 2022, some 60 years after the first Romualdez house speaker, the nephew of Imelda, Martin Romualdez, became the second Romualdez speaker of the house and then in 2025 his nephew, Ferdinand “Sandro” Marcos III, was the first to sign the impeachment complaint against VP Sara Duterte. It will be interesting to see how this real-life Game of Thrones will continue. This week's column is more of a personal write-up, though still about uncles. My mom's brother, Bebot, is celebrating his 70th birthday on Valentine's Day, but we flew to Manila a week before for a surprise party. My uncle has always been close to my mom, both being the youngest in the family; my uncle the youngest son and my mom being the youngest daughter. Over the years, I have seen how protective and generous and caring my uncle is of my mom, and over time I have also received this generosity and care from him. As a natural family historian even at an early age, I was always asking my grandmother about the family. At an early age, I learned that my uncle was nicknamed “Bebot”, which is quite different from his real given name, because he was a “big boy”, which later permutated to Bebot. At the same time, he has always been someone who embodies the true meaning of the day he was born on. Because he was born in a year that was declared a Marian year, my grandmother gave him a name that reflected this. He became a devotee of the Virgin Mary, and loved everyone close to him like a mother loves her family. Pure, unconditional love. All his life, he always made sure everyone he came in contact with would be showered with love and respect. I remember a time when I needed three months' worth of rent for a condo, and I asked to borrow the amount from him. He did not ask any questions and simply transferred the money to my account. I tried to give him my payment on Christmas that same year, but he just shook his head and refused the cash I had in my hand and he said ""don't worry. That's for you. No need to pay me.” For most of his life, he made sure his family, especially my grandparents, were financially secure and well taken care of. As my mom has always said, my uncle’s generosity knows no limit. During his surprise party last week, I learned so many new things about my uncle. Even though he worked in some of the largest corporations all his life, my uncle was and has always been a simple and down-to-earth person who never bragged about his achievements. It was refreshing to hear new information about him, because it makes his generous nature become more solid. Happy birthday, Uncle Bebot, and I wish you more birthdays to come! And Happy Valentine’s Day to the readers of The FREEMAN!"
1,"Why are Filipino candidates spending millions, even billions of pesos just for political ads? Why do politicians never stop buying votes, attempting to bribe election officials, and cheating during elections? And why are candidates interfering in the distribution of AKAP, AICS, and TUPAD? The answer is obvious and a no-brainer. The taxpayers are paying so much money in terms of salaries, allowances, travel expenses, representation, and other officials, not to mention millions in confidential funds. They also get to hire their close friends as consultants on 15-30 basis, they exercise influence in getting their relatives appointed as judges, prosecutors, arbiters, commissioners, and even non-career ambassadors and consuls. This country with millions of people living below the poverty line is paying high compensation to politicians, many of whom are incompetent, inept, and corrupt. Let us examine the salaries of top officials and we are talking only of visible and declared income. Not to mention the commissions paid by contractors and suppliers and some kickbacks for multi-million government projects and purchases. The president of the Philippines, with salary grade 33 is paid no less than a monthly salary of ?423,723 or an annual compensation of ?5,040,676 translated to ?30,508,055 for six years in office, not counting the bonuses and allowances for travel, representation, health and life insurance, and housing subsidies and educational assistance for dependents and beneficiaries. The vice president, the Senate president and the speaker of the House have the same salary grade of 32 and equal monthly salary of ?374,678 or an annual income of ?4,496,136. Again, we do not count the many allowances, perks, privileges and almost unlimited opportunities for travel at the expense of the taxpayers. The senators and the congressmen have the same salary grade of 31 and monthly salary of ?312,902 or an annual compensation package of ?3,754,824 or ?11,264,472 for three years for members of the House and ?22,528,844 for the six-year term of every senator. Can you imagine ?11,264,472 for the three years’ salary for every member of the Lower House means ?3.559 billion and for six years that will be more than double that amount. For senators, we need to spend ?540 billion for six years for 24 senators. And there are senators who do not even know the provisions of the Constitution. There are senators who do not know the nuances of lawmaking. There are some who do not fully understand the principles of checks and balances and separation of powers. In the local levels, governors of first-class provinces and city mayors of first-class cities receive no less than ?207,978 monthly basic salary. That does not include the perks, privileges and many allowances. The vice governor and the city vice mayor each receive a salary of ?162,877. A municipal mayor, depending on the class of municipalities they head, receives a monthly salary ranging from ?185,695 to ?204,054. A councilor receives a monthly salary of ?54,000 to ?144,000 and a barangay captain from ?13,000 to ?36,000. The governor's and the city mayor's annual salary amounts to ?2,495,736. Again, we do not count the multiple allowances and confidential funds that they disburse with scant limitations. They can appoint job-order workers among their close friends and trusted political allies. They can travel to foreign countries with public funds to finance their airfare and hotel accommodations. They can hire many consultants to reward their political leaders and they can create all scenarios to be funded by the taxpayers' money. There are two female candidates for senators who have already spent more than ?1 billion each in political ads alone even before the official campaign period. Why are they investing a lot of money? Well, all such investments can easily be recovered in a matter of time. Being in government is no longer a public service, it has already become a big business. The people are poor and the taxes go higher and higher. It is the politicians who are making heydays while the poor continue to suffer in hunger and poverty. What is happening to our country?"
1,"KINAKAPA ko ngayon sa mga kababayang Pilipino ang alab ng pagmamahal at pagmamalasakit sa kinagisnang kaugalian. Ang pagiging bukas palad sa sinumang lumalapit ay nagbunga nang masamang alamat. Naging mapagbigay, hanggang sa mamulubi! Sa Philippine History book na lamang mababasa ang magagandang ginawa ng mga ninunong namuno sa bansa. Ang ayuda ay nagmumula sa lakas ng mamamayan upang maging kalakasan ng isinusulong na mamumuno sa bayan. Hindi tulad ngayon na ang “ayuda” ay ginawang “limos” na hinuhugot sa kaban ng bayan. Ninanakawan pa! Naglipana ang mga benipisyaryo ng Persons “Without” Disabilties (PWD), Ayaw Kumilos At Palamunin (AKAP), Tusong Panloloko sa Ating Dispalinghadong (TUPAD) gobyerno na inimbento ng mga pulitiko para salaulain ang dangal ng bawat Pilipino. Tuwing may eleksiyon noon ay bumabaha ng pera mula sa mga kandidato, ngayon ay bagyo ang dating ng mga ayudang nagmumula sa pondo ng bayan. Libre gastos na sa kampanya at malamang may sobra pa! Noon, kapag malapit na ang eleksyon ay ipinagagawa ng mga pulitiko ang mga sirang kalsada. Ngayon, ay ginigiba ang maayos na kalsada para kumita sila. May “karma” ‘yan mga Sir! Ibi­nibili ng mga pulitiko ang pera ng bayan ng mga ambulansya at nakatatak ang mga pangalan nila. May burial benefits pa silang ibinibigay. Eh bakit hindi sila bumibili ng karo ng patay at lagyan din ng pangalan nila? Patay kang bata ka! Sinisiraan nila ang mga kalaban nila, samantalang magkakatulong sila na i-programa ang pera ng bayan para paghati hatian nila. Totoo di ba? Hmmm! Kinakalap ng barangay captains ang listahan ng malalaking pamilya. Ginagawa nilang empleyado sa barangay ang ilan sa kanila. Pagdating ng eleksiyon, siyempre coordinators na sila with extra pay pa! Kaway kaway din si Kapitan kasama ang kandidato kapag nag-house to house na si kandidato. Bawal yaannn!"
1,"CEBU, Philippines — Mandaue City Mayor Glenn Bercede dismissed concerns of ""intense political rivalry"" in the city, asserting that, from their perspective, no such rivalry exists. This was Bercede’s response after the Commission on Elections in Central Visayas (Comelec-7) intensified its monitoring efforts in four areas of Cebu, including Mandaue City, due to “intense political rivalry” among local candidates ahead of the May 2025 elections. “Sa part namo, sa among bahin wala,” said Bercede. Despite facing political setbacks, particularly alongside his running mate, former mayor Jonas Cortes, he emphasized that they never considered seeking revenge against anyone. “So meaning wala mi ana,” said Bercede. He added that he cannot conclude whether there is political rivalry in their city, as they have been solely focused on strengthening their political party for the upcoming elections. “Kami maningkamot lang mi sa amoa,” said Bercede. Comelec-7 Regional Director Atty. Francisco Pobe earlier said that their monitoring efforts are focused on Cebu City, Mandaue City, and the second and fourth districts of Cebu Province. On the other hand, Pobe clarified that these areas have not been classified as “areas of concern” but are instead under “areas of monitoring.” In response, Bercede expressed support for Comelec-7’s efforts, emphasizing the importance of preventing any untoward incidents and ensuring a peaceful election, particularly in Mandaue City. “Mas labing maayo aron naay safety sa Mandauehanons,” said Bercede. The city mayor hopes that even though Comelec-7 has observed intense political rivalry in their city, it will not result in any negative outcomes for the community. He added that although there is competition for positions in Mandaue, each candidate has their own strategy, and so far, all political parties have remained peaceful. Bercede acknowledged that criticisms between candidates and rivals are a natural part of politics, especially as the elections draw closer. Despite the competition among candidates, he emphasized that Mandaue City has continued to maintain peaceful elections. “Politika tingali naa ang mga pagsaway pero ang nanaway pod ang mga trolls raman sad. Ang mga politiko wala man,” Bercede said. He added that there have been no direct exchanges between the two other camps, and most of the harsh or below-the-belt remarks usually come from their supporters rather than the politicians themselves. Mayor Bercede is vying for the Vice Mayor position in Mandaue City under Team Mandaue, facing off incumbent Vice Mayor Nerissa Soon-Ruiz of One Mandaue. Meanwhile, for Mandaue’s lone congressional district, incumbent Congresswoman Emmarie “Lollypop” Ouano-Dizon is seeking re-election, facing a challenge from political newcomer and former Mandaue City Treasurer, Atty. Regal Oliva. Comelec-7 has earlier reported that Central Visayas remains generally peaceful regarding armed confrontations and election-related violence. However, the regional poll body emphasized the need for vigilance. – ATO (CEBU NEWS)"
1,"NASA bingit nang malaking gulo ang buong mundo at maaring kasangkapanin na naman ng mga naghaharing bansa ang Pilipinas hinggil sa usapin sa West Philippine Sea kasabay ng iringan ng Taiwan at China. Nakakapangilabot isipin na bagama’t nanganganib na ­madamay tayo sa sigalutan nang malalaking bansa, nakatutok pa rin ang Kongreso at Senado sa pondo ng bayan na ang malaking bahagi ay nakasentro sa demonyitong pamumulitika. Pwe! Wala ni isa man sa mga tumatakbong kandidato ang tumatalakay sa banta ng kahirapan, bagkus lalo pang pinaghihirap ang mamamayan dahil sa kanilang pagsasamantala sa kaban ng bayan. May mainit na AKAP naman daw para sa mahihirap. Lantaran ang kawalan ng delikadesa ng mga pulitikong tinalo pa ang mga tipaklong sa paglundag sa political party ng administrasyon para makasalo sa luho. Mga pulitikong kung laitin ang pamilya Marcos noon ay suko sa langit. Ayks! As in AICS? Bumabalato lang po. Hindi naman masama ang political dynasty kung naging tagapagpalago at nakapagpaganda ng kanilang nasasakupan. Huwag naman ‘yung pamilyang nagungurakot lang. Andami na nila! Hindi rin masama kung artista ang kumakandidato, basta may kakayahan at may sapat na talino sa tungkuling inaasinta. Hindi ‘yung umarte lang ang alam at Ombudsman at Sandiganbayan ang kahahantungan. Di ba? Malaking bahagi rin ang pagkakawatak-watak ng mga kristiyano dahil sa pulitika. Noon ay lantaran ang naging panawagan ng Simbahang Katoliko na dinaluhan din ng mga pulitiko para makiisa sa EDSA Prayer Rally na naging People Power Revolution. Okey naman ‘di ba? Nang manawagan kamakailan ang Iglesia ni Cristo ng Rally for Peace sa Luneta ay hindi na ito tinantanan ng panlalait. Hindi na tama ‘yan! Ang Pilipinas ay bansang malaya para pumili kung anong relihiyon ang sasaniban. Amen po ba?"
1,"SIMULA na ng kampanya sa pagka-Senador, bagamat marami ang noon pa nagpasimula ng patagong pangangampanya. Tatlong taon pa ang eleksyong pampanguluhan, pero ngayon pa lamang ay marami na ang nagpaparamdam. Sobra ang pulitika dito sa atin. Inaalmusal natin ang pulitika. Ito ang ating pambansang libangan. Ang pulitika, per se, ay hindi naman masama. Ang totoong kahulugan ng pulitika ay siyensya o sining ng maayos na pamamahala. Mahalaga ang pulitika sa progreso.  Kaya sumasama ang pulitika ay dahil sa maling paggamit nito. Sabi ni Henry Brooks Adams, “Dahil sa nakasanayan, ang pulitika ay naging sistematikong organisasyon ng mga pagkamuhi.” Ang nakakalungkot, ito ang uri ng pulitika na natutuhan nating mga Pilipino. Ang alam nating pulitika ay ‘yong madugong pulitika, kung kaya’t dito sa atin, ang pulitika ay isang madugong sport. Napakatindi ng epekto ng masamang pulitika sa moralidad ng lipunan. Sabi ni Otto von Bismarck, “Winawasak ng pulitika ang karakter ng isang tao.”  Si Louis McHenry Howe ay nagsagawa ng ganitong paglalagom, “Hindi maaaring manatili kang tapat kung gagawin mong isang propesyon ang pulitika.” Katapatan, ‘yan ang numero unong biktima ng masamang pulitika. Binigyan ni Shakespeare ng depinisyon ang pulitiko na ganito, “Isang taong iniimbento maging ang Diyos.” Si Nikita Khrushchev naman ay nagsabi na, “Magkakapareho ang mga pulitiko kahit saan. Mangangako silang magtatayo ng tulay kahit walang ilog.” Heto ang malaking problema, wala na tayong mga Recto, Diokno, Tañada, Salonga, Aquino.  Ang marami sa atin ngayon ay mga pulitikong ang pinangangalagaan lamang ay ang sariling interest; mga pulitikong ang gusto’y pinaglilingkuran, sa halip na nagilingkod. Patuloy na winawasak ng pulitika ang ating karakter bilang isang lahi.  Nawawala na ang “palabra de onor” at “delikadesa” na noon ay tatak ng lahing Pilipino. Sa panahon ng eleksyon, ang mga pulitiko ay palipat-lipat ng partido na animo’y mga paru-paro na naghahanap ng masisimsim na nektar ng bulaklak.  Ang dating magkakaaway ay biglang nagiging magkakaibigan.  Ang dating magkakaibigan ay biglang nagiging magkakaaway. Maraming Pilipino ang tila hindi na nalalaman ang pagkakaiba ng masama sa mabuti.  Binoboto natin maging ang mga nakakulong at may mga kinakaharap na kaso. Ang posisyon sa gobyerno ay naging pampamilya na.  Pagkatapos ng tatay, ‘yon namang nanay, pagkatapos ng nanay, ‘yong anak, pagkatapos ‘yong apo, ‘yong manugang, ‘yong kapatid, ‘yong lolo, ‘yong pinsan. Mayroon pa ba tayong pag-asa?  Pag-asa na lamang ang mayroon tayo.  Alisin mo ang pag-asang ito, at lahat tayo’y masasawi bilang isang lahi. Dapat tayong maniwala na may magagawa tayo kung tayo’y magkakaisa at makikisangkot sa lipunan. Ang pulitika ay dapat masakop ng Kaharian ng Diyos.  Sa tuwing matatapos ang eleksyon, nagagalit tayo kapag nahalal ang isang tiwali. Kapag naging Senador ang isang walang nalalaman.  Kapag naging Kongresista ang isang jueteng lord. Kapag naging gobernador ang isang trapo.  Kapag naging mayor ang isang basag-ulero. Ang tanong, mayroon ba tayong ginawa upang mahalal ang isang karapat-dapat? Wala tayong karapatang magngangawa at magreklamo kung wala naman tayong ginagawa. --Sumanib tayo sa mga kilusang lalaban sa maruming pulitika. Ang eleksyon ay isang gawaing espirituwal. Ang balota ay sagrado. Kailanman, hindi makapangingibabaw ang maruming pulitika kung ang bawat tunay na Kristiano’y magmamahal sa bansa at makikisangkot sa mahahalagang isyung panlipunan."
1,"CEBU, Philippines — This was the evaluation of Cebu City Mayor Raymond Alvin Garcia when asked for his reaction on the slashing of his proposed budget from P17.9 billion to P14.6 billion. The P14.6 budget was officially approved and signed by Cebu City Vice Mayor Donaldo Hontiveros last Saturday while he was serving as acting mayor. The political alliances in Cebu City were defined in October. Cebu City's Legislative officials were primarily members of the majority bloc under Partido BARUG Team Rama, led by dismissed Mayor Michael Rama. However, when Garcia announced his official bid for the 2025 mayoral race, the majority bloc became divided. Most members aligned with Garcia’s ticket, while others chose to remain loyal to Partido BARUG. While the deliberations for the budget were intense, one of the most heavily discussed topics was the trimming down of budget appropriations for ""pro-poor"" programs, particularly the provision of dole outs to the public. Some council members emphasized that it was time for the Cebu City government to realign budgetary allocations toward investments rather than dole outs. Garcia, however, said that the P17.9 billion budget proposal was intended to focus on investments for Cebu City. ""We had a lot of initiatives, for example, flood control nga ila sad gi-reduced. We wanted to build up mini dams so that ma-lessen atong flooding diri sa ubos and then that will also bring investments and then it will attract more investor to come,"" said Garcia. He then argued that of the P17.9 billion, it was unreasonable not to allot at least P100 million for livelihood or economic grants, which, to him, the people need. During the budget deliberation, Councilor Jocelyn Pesquera noted that the city’s social programs had been consuming at least 60 percent of the city government's budget, draining its coffers. She also emphasized that it was high time the city allocated more funds for investments and infrastructure. According to Garcia, his proposal was supposed to be a ""balanced budget"" that considered various factors, including infrastructure, pro-poor programs, and agriculture. ""Sad to say nga ni focus lang gyud sila kining atong mga pro-poor programs kay mao lagi na, di man ko maka blame nila kay as I have said, political season,"" said Garcia. He reiterated a comparison to the previous budget of P50 billion in 2023 and P25 billion in 2024, both of which were approved and proposed by a different administration. ""Now, with the P17.9 billion, which is very realistic, they reduced it. So, of course, politics plays a role in these things,"" said Garcia. Garcia, having been in politics for quite a while, said he ""understands"" the political scene and that the events surrounding the budget have been influenced by it. Garcia added that he is ""definite"" that the fallout among council members contributed to the polarization of their stance on the budget, which eventually led to a divided house. ""I don't want to put it in a negative light but of course, that has something to do with elections and politics, kay mao gud na ilang gi tyabaw, dole outs, dole outs,"" said Garcia. According to him, dole outs are still necessary in government but should not be overemphasized. He noted that it was during the time of Rama, his former political ally and running mate, that financial assistance for senior citizens, including persons with disabilities (PWDs), was introduced. He admitted, however, that dole outs should be utilized in moderation. Additionally, one of the areas trimmed down was the Climate Mitigation and Adaptation budget, which was reduced from P100 million to P1. Garcia expressed disappointment, saying there were various plans that could have been executed had the budget been approved, especially in terms of infrastructure for flood mitigation, such as drainage installations and mini dams in upland areas. He added that it could also have helped with irrigation for farmers. ""I am kind of disappointed nga ila ng gi slash kay this could really help a lot in our flood mitigation programs,"" said Garcia. Despite the trimmed budget, Garcia expressed satisfaction with how the council deliberated on the annual budget, adding that P14.6 billion is still a workable sum. It was during the same deliberation when Councilor Noel Wenceslao, chairman of the Committee on Budget and Finance, delivered his committee report, which officially recommended multiple amendments. As indicated in the committee report, the City Treasurer's Office reported that the city’s revenue as of October 31, 2024, was just over P8 billion, a significant shortfall compared to the projected income of more than P98 billion. Based on this, the committee also noted that the city’s actual income was far below the target income for 2024. After scrutiny, the council approved the committee report on second reading, despite seven objections. In the same session, Wenceslao also motioned for the approval of the Annual Budget for 2025, with the amended amount of P14.6 billion, which was also approved despite the seven objections. — (FREEMAN)"
1,"Nasayod na kita sa kahulogan sa politika. Apan, ato kining hisgutan pagbalik dinhi, tungod kay adunay nag-ingon nga lahi kuno ang mga practices sa politika dinhi sa atong nasud. Atong mabasa sa Roget’s Thesaurus ang mga synonyms ug kahulogan sa pulong ‘politics.’ “Political science, art of government, administration of public affairs, practice of government, affairs of state, government policy, statecraft, statesmanship.” So, politics per se, dili dirty. Pili lang sa imong nauyonan nga mga kahulogan ug synonyms sa pulong ‘politika,’ ug pangutan-a ang imong kaugalingon kon mao ba kini ang imong nasinati nga mga practices sa atong mga political leaders. Ayaw pag-generalize, kay labing seguro adunay mga exceptions. Adunay tarong nga mga politicians. Nangutana kita sa Google, what is the traditional political culture in the Philippines? Tubag: “The traditional system employs patronage politics or living up to the cultural expectation that the politician should act as a patron. This means doling out money and personally attending to any community or personal needs of one's constituents. Traditional politics is money-based politics.” Ngil-ad paminawon no? Mga phrases sama sa ‘patronage politics, patron, doling out money, ug money-based politics,’ langil-ngig paminawon. Tingalig gi-exaggerate lang kini sa google. Perhaps, mao usab kini ang mga practices sa ubang nasud, apan dili lang kaayo tunog. On the other hand, wa ba mo kamatikod, nga sa kadaghan ug kadagko sa atong problema sa mi-prevail ug misiaw man hinuon ang politika? Inay mag-usa aron mogaan ang pagpas-an sa mga bug-at kaayo nga problema, nagpinahitay na hinuon. Matud ni Pope Francis, nga atong ma-apply sa atong kahimtang karon, “We have so much to do. And we must do it together.” Together? Lisud, o imposible ‘togetheron’ ang Pinoy. Kini tungod kay tagsa-tagsa kanato adunay mga hidden agenda, kasagaran for personal well-being ug katuyoan. Dili maihap sa tudlo ang mga problema nga ato karong gisagubang, ambot ngano nga nagpakapabuta-bungol man lang atong mga political leaders. Ang politika man hinuon ang ilang gi-prioritized, nga layo pa man unta ang 2028 presidential election. Tingali aduany pipila kanilang taga-gobierno nga nagpakabana, mga non-politicians, mga executives, ug mga professional nga department heads, nga wala maduhig ug wala madutli sa ‘dirty politics.’ Ang Google mihatag og example sa mga olitical practices sa atong nasud, “Graft and corruption practices before, during, and after elections. For instance, vote buying and ‘dagdag-bawas’ practices in the counting of votes.” Tinuod ni? In my case, for instance, sukad, wa may misuway pagpalit sa akong voto. Tingali og nagtuo sila nga dili ko modawat. Anyway, sa pangutana ngano nga napabiling kabus ang atong nasud, graft and corruption maoy usa sa gipasanginlan sa mga objective nga political analysts. Laing gipasanginlan mao ang atong kapakyas pag-develop sa atong rich natural resources, nga sa ato untang pagka-agricultural country, dili unta kita karon ma-problema sa bugas. Unsa man ning ideology sa mga political parties? “A political ideology is a certain set of ethical ideals, principles, and doctrines of a social movement, institution, class or large group.They favor minimal government interference in the economy and prefer private sector-based solutions to problems.”"
1,"HINDI lamang bagyo ng kalikasan ang sunud-sunod na tumatama sa atin ngayon. Matindi rin ang tama sa atin ng bagyo ng pulitika, may dala-dalang hangin na tunay na mapangwasak. Ang pinakahuling bagyong-pulitikal ay ang bangayan ng dalawang pinakamataas na lider ng ating bansa—ang Presidente at Bise Presidente—parang super typhoon. Malaki ang hinala ng Bise Presidente na ipapapatay siya ng Presidente, kung kaya’t sinabi niya sa media na kung siya’y mapapatay, may kinausap na siyang mamamatay-tao para patayin ang Presidente, ang First Lady at ang Senate President. Parang isa lamang malaking biro, pero paulit-ulit na sinabi ng Bise Presidente na hindi ito biro. Dahil hindi biro, nahaharap siya ngayon sa posibleng kasong kriminal, impeachment proceedings, at pagkansela sa kanyang lisensya bilang abogado. Kung hindi man ito super typhoon, pwedeng ikategoryang intensity 7 na lindol. Ang bangayang ito’y headline ng mga diaryo at telebisyon sa buong mundo. Sikat na naman ang Pilipinas! Samantala, sira ang lahat ng ginagawang panghihikayat ng kasalukuyang administrasyon na akitin ang mga dayuhang mamumuhunan. Sino ba namang matinong negosyante ang mamumuhunan sa isang bansang ang dalawang pinakamataas na lider ay posibleng magpatayan? Napakahalaga ng role models sa isang lipunan. Ito’y mga lider na tinutularan o ­pinamamarisan ng mga tagasunod o karaniwang mamamayan. Ang mga lider ang naglalagay ng hangganan sa maaaring marating ng mga tagasunod. Kung astang-maton ang lider, hindi mo aasahang mag-aastang-santo ang mga tagasunod. Kung walang makitang role models mula sa gobyerno, hahanap ang mga tao ng pamamarisan mula sa pelikula na mas malamang ay malayo sa katotohanan ang ipinapakitang pagkatao. Dahil sa masamang ehemplo ng matataas na lider mula sa gobyerno, negosyo at maging sa simbahan, panipis nang panipis ang tinatawag na moral fiber ng ating lipunan.  Ang moral fiber ay ang panloob na lakas upang ipaglaban kung ano ang tama, totoo, at makatarungan sa harap man ng napakahirap na sitwasyon. Nakakatakot, baka ang panipis nang panipis na moral fiber ay biglang mapunit. Kapag ito’y napunit, ang integridad at pagiging tapat ay magiging ala-ala na lamang ng kahapon. Flawed character, baluktot o may depektong pagkatao, ito ang nakalulungkot na komentaryo ng ilang social scientists tungkol sa atin. Ang mali ay ginagawa nating tama; ang tama ay ginagawa nating mali. Ang sumusunod sa trapiko bagamat walang nanghuhuli ay sinasabihang mahinang driver. Ang nagmumura at nagkukuwento ng mga green jokes kahit sa mga pormal na pagtitipon ay tinatawanan. Ang mga kuwentong walang kabuluhan basta’t nanggaling sa lider ay pinapalakpakan. Kahit biro ay tinototoo, basta’t nanggaling sa lider. Para tayo umunlad, kailangang ang una nating buoin ay ang ating wasak na pagkatao, kaysa ating ekonomiya. Ang pinakamahalagang kayamanan ng isang bansa ay ang mga mamamayan nito, hindi ang ganda ng kalikasan o dami ng reserbang ginto. Hangga’t may natitirang isang Pilipino na modelo ang pagkatao ay may pag-asa pa tayo. At hindi naman nag-iisa lang ‘yan. Sila ang pagmumulan ng laksa-laksa. Kapag ang laksa-laksang ito’y sumunod sa tagubilin sa Santiago 1:21, “Kaya’t talikuran na ninyo ang inyong maruruming gawa at alisin ang masasamang asal; mapagpakumbabang tanggapin ninyo ang salitang itinanim sa inyong puso—ito ay may kakayahang magligtas sa inyo,” babangon ang Pilipinas mula sa masamang bangungot."
1,"Politics used to be an honorable word but the politicians made it dirty. Politics was a means to achieve noble ends, to lead people in the democratic pursuit of making the nation better, the people happier, and the government a more effective instrument for peace, justice, and prosperity. Today, politics is a means to commit plunder, steal public funds by conspiracy among political dynasties, led by shameless trapos who rose to power by buying votes, corrupting the system, and conniving with foreign powers. During the golden years, in America, when one mentioned the word ""politics"", the Americans would call to mind such illustrious statesmen as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and later, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Jimmy Carter. Now, politics is identified with Donald Trump, a twice-impeached, many times-convicted and notorious racist. A misogynist who does not believe in diversity, inclusiveness, and equity. The American voters have chosen a man who declared to become a dictator on his first day in office, who admires Hitler, Putin, and Xi Jinping. He hates immigrants including Asians, Mexicans, and his people call Puerto Rico an island of garbage. In the Philippines, we have had such honorable political leaders as Manuel L. Quezon, Sergio Osmeña Sr., Ramon Magsaysay, Carlos P. Garcia, and Diosdado Macapagal. They were men who made great sacrifices serving the government and the people. They never stole money from public funds. They never asked their wives, children, or grandchildren to run for public office during their incumbency. They did not use their powers in order to enrich themselves and protect their business empires. They did not rise to high positions by the power of guns, goons, and terrorism. They never used money to buy votes and never sold juicy positions to business leaders who corrupt the government agencies. During our own golden years of Philippine politics, we have had some really brilliant and nationalistic senators who gave honor to the Philippine Senate and made the legislature a means to make policies that promote general welfare, There were truly eminent, learned, and patriotic leaders like Claro M. Recto, Lorenzo Tañada, Quintin Paredes, Jose P. Laurel, Juan Liwag, Camilo Osias, Mariano Jesus Cuenco, and later such stalwarts as Arturo Tolentino, Ambrocio Padilla, Jovito Salonga, Jose W. Diokno, Ramon Mitra, Raul Manglapus, Francisco Rodrigo, and Benigno Aquino Jr. There were truly amazing female senators like Geronima Pecson, Maria Kalaw Katigbak, Eva Estrada Kalaw, Tecla San Andres Ziga, Helen Benitez, Magnolia Antonino, Leticia Ramos Shahani and, of course, Miriam Defensor Santiago. Today, we have a former prisoner who was convicted and incarcerated in Muntinlupa sitting in the august hall where Claro M. Recto used to preside. We have senators who were charged with plunder with Janet Napoles and who are now sitting as investigators of lesser men and women charged with less serious crimes. We have senators who continue their careers as movie actors and TV hosts all the while getting salaries and allowances as members of the Philippine Senate. We used to have many basketball players who landed in the Senate not because they know how to legislate but because of sheer popularity. We have boxers, comedians, and action stars who aspire to become legislators, and there are high risks of them winning. In Cebu, we used to have very distinguished members of the Senate, like Don Filemon and Don Vicente Sotto, Don Sergio Osmeña Sr., Manuel Briones, Mariano Jesus Cuenco, and later Sergio Osmeña Jr., John H Osmeña, Serge Osmeña, Marcelo Fernan, and Ernesto Herrera. Today, we do not even have one in that august body. Good people do not want to go into politics anymore. The ones who have personal and business agenda are dominating the government, with very few exceptions, of course. Politics is now a dirty word and good men and women do not want to be tainted by it."
1,"WALANG permanenteng kaibigan o kaaway, permanen­teng interes lamang. Isang bahagyang bersiyon ng pahayag ni Lord Palmerston, isang 19th-century British prime minister. Ang siniping ito ay kadalasang nauugnay sa pulitika, at ito ay nagbubuod kung ano ang nagaganap sa Pilipinas. Ang kasalukuyang poot ni Vice President Sara Duterte sa pamilya Marcos ang magandang halimbawa. Parang naalala ko ang pagpapares ni Marcos-Duterte bilang Team Unity noong kampanya noong 2022. Pero mukhang nabuwag na nga ang Unity. Sa nakalipas na ilang pagdinig sa Senado, ipinapaliwanag kay Sara kung paano nagastos ang confidential funds noong siya ay secretary ng Department of Education (DepEd) at kanyang sariling tanggapan bilang Vice President. Nag-ugat ito sa hindi pagpayag ng Commission on Audit (COA) na P15.54 milyon mula sa P112.5 milyong confidential fund expenses ng DepEd noong 2023 at kung pa­ano ginastos ang P500 milyon na confidential at intel­li­gence funds ng Office of the Vice President (OVP) kung saan mahigit kalahati ay hindi pinayagan ng COA. Lumabas din na ang OVP ay gumastos ng P125 milyon sa loob lamang ng 11 araw. Ngunit sa halip na magbigay ng mga sagot at paliwanag, tila nilihis ni Sara ang mga isyu. Naglabas siya ng mga ma­panlait na pahayag laban kay President Bongbong Marcos Jr. tulad ng pahayag na “hindi niya alam kung paano maging presidente.” Pinagsisisihan ang pakikipagtambal kay Marcos sa panahon ng kampanya, humingi ng paumanhin sa mga miyem­bro ng Kingdom of Jesus Christ ni Apollo Quiboloy sa pag­­hiling sa kanila na iboto si Marcos, at binibigkas ang kan­yang pinakamasamang pahayag sa pagbabantang huhukayin ang katawan ni Ferdinand Marcos Sr. at ita­tapon daw sa West Philippine Sea. Marami sa pulitika ang nagsabing wala na sa lugar si Sara. Sabi ng anak ni BBM na si Sandro Marcos, hindi raw nararapat ang mga pahayag ng Vice President, walang pakundangan at desperado. Sa nakikita ko, patay na ang tambalan nina Sara at BBM. Ang mga pampublikong pondo, maging confidential man, ay dapat may paliwanag. Hindi sana pinuna ng COA ang mga bahagi ng mga gastusin ng OVP at DedEd kung hindi ito masusuri. Kung legal at nararapat naman ang lahat ng gastusin, hindi dapat mahirap magbigay ng paliwanag at pagpapakita ng mga sumusuportang dokumento. Ngunit nagpatuloy ang Vice President at inakusahan ang Kongreso na plano siyang i-impeached at lahat nang pag-atake sa kanya ay pulitika lamang. Kaya mukhang wala nang balakid ang mga maaanghang na pahayag laban sa pamilya Marcos. Rumesponde kaya si PBBM?"
1,"The Filipino people have rejected family dynasties, when they ratified by overwhelming votes the 1987 Philippine Constitution. But Congress, which is controlled by trapos, continues to refuse enacting the enabling Anti-Family Dynasty Law. And so, today, dynasty politics is reaching its pinnacle from the Senate down to the smallest municipalities and barangays. And this is very bad. We have three Tulfos who will be in the Senate in 2025, joining two Cayetanos, two  Villars, and two  Ejercito/Estradas. These elite families will be joined by trapos like Tito Sotto, Imee Marcos, perhaps an Abalos, another Binay, billionaire Pacquiao again, Revilla, Lapid and, my God, by Philip Salvador, Willy Revillame, and Jimmy Bondoc. The party-list is dominated by ageing actors and actresses, like Nora Aunor of Peoples' Champ, Zanjoe Marudo of Asap, and even such characters as Diwata. They are desecrating the spirit of the august body, the legislature of the land. Family dynasties dominate the LGUs. Vilma Santos is running for Batangas governor again with Luis Manzano, son of Edu, for vice governor and Christian, son of Ralph Recto, for congressman. What is happening to our country? The president is BBM. The sister Imee is running for senator, the son Sandro for Ilocos Norte congressman. Imee's son, Matthew Manotoc, son of Tommy Manotoc, is gunning for reelection as governor with auntie Araneta Marcos as vice governor. Keon, cousin of BBM, is running for Laoag city mayor again, and another cousin, Barba, is gunning for representative of another district in the same province. The Dys and the Albanos continue to monopolize power in Isabela. The Ortegas still dominate La Union.  The Pinedas control Pampanga in the same manner that  the Umalis control Nueva Ecija, the Romans and the Garcias dominate Bataan and Ebdanes have entrenched themselves in Zambales. In Metro Manila, the Gatchalians have consolidated powers in Valenzuela, the Binays have been in control in Makati, the Zamoras have taken San Juan from the Estradas, but the Aguilar-Villar domination of Las Piñas and the Olivarez control of  Paranaque remain impregnable. The Cayetanos are being challenged by the Ceraficas in Taguig and the Eusebios, using a dummy, are trying to regain Pasig from Vico Sotto. Antipolo and the entire Rizal Province still under the domination of the Ynarez and Puno families with cracks put up by a young man from the Nograles Clan of Davao. Marikina is now being contested by the Teodoros and the Quimpos. And term-limited senator Koko Pimentel is joining the congressional fray in the city of shoes. Going down to Bicol, the Villafuertes still control Camsur and the Salcedas and Lagmans are fighting in Albay. Masbate now has a new name, Masbate Kho. All important posts are occupied by members of the Kho family. The Garcias of Cebu, the Aumentados of Bohol, the Lacsons and Teveses of Negros, the Romualdez clan, the Velosos, Caris, and Javiers of Leyte, the Espinas of Biliran, the Mercados of Southern Leyte, the Tans of Samar, the Romualdos of Camiguin, the Oaminal Family dynasty in  Misamis Occidental, and the Diaporos, Alontos, and Adiongs of the Lanao provinces, the Ampatuans and Mangudadatus of Cotabato. The Dutertes and the Nograles clans, Garcias and other smaller dynasties in Davao City, all these elite families are controlling power and resources in Mindanao. It is indeed a land of promise: the politicians got all the land, and the people got all the promises. This nation shall remain a struggling economy, with more than one-half of its wealth being controlled by greedy, power-hungry, and autocratic families. China has already penetrated our government systems, and America is trying to dominate foreign affairs through the dynasties that are the minions, subalterns, and dummies of foreign powers. I am tempted to become a Canadian citizen or a national of Timbuktu. This is not the country envisioned by both the 1935 and the 1987 constitutions."
1,"CEBU, Philippines — Despite political coalitions and alliances already being made by their prospective political opponents for the mayoral seat of Cebu City, City Councilor Nestor Archival and former customs commissioner Yogi Felimon Ruiz remain unperturbed, saying they remain confident of their political visions. While the filing of the Certificate of Candidacy (COC) has officially began and Mayor Michael Rama’s Partido BARUG-Team Rama already formed a partnership with Bag-ong Sugbo and Acting Mayor Raymond Alvin Garcia’s Kugi, Uswag Sugbo(KUSUG) forming an alliance with Panaghiusa, both men are yet to unveil their complete political slate. In an interview yesterday, Archival said they are eyeing to file their COCs on Oct. 7 or 8 yet. He assured that they are ""ready enough” for the elections and that Bando Osmen?a Pundok Kauswagan BOPK) has a “complete slate” that he could not disclose yet. With the various changes in political alliances, particularly with the parting of ways of Rama, who is serving a preventive suspension, and Garcia, Archival said they have repercussion on the “changing political dynamics” in the city. Both Garcia and Rama have announced their intent to run for mayor. ""But in our case, wala man mi nag-usab,"" Archival said. Archival, who is teaming up with former mayor Tomas Osmeña as his vice mayor, said that ""consistency"" in their alliance will be their edge because it equates to the buildup of trust. ""Kay kung makita nimo ang usa ka party mag-usab-usab, then ang policy in the future might be mag-usab-usab pud, the cohesiveness,"" Archival said. He said their party has been intact since its inception and that they didn't get candidates from other parties. On BOPK members that are now allied with other political parties, specifically Liga ng mga Barangay President Franklyn Ong and incumbent north district Representative Rachel ""Cutie"" del Mar, Archival said that was due to the uncertain direction of BOPK in the beginning. ""If you are going to look at it, ang BOPK mura’g wala dayon, kay gitan-aw pa ang situation, but eventually, when we started it all, naka-commit na sila sa some other parties,"" he said. He said that when BOPK began publicizing its intent to join the political battle once again, Ong was already in talks with Rama, hence his (Ong) alliance with BARUG. Archival also said that while they are currently beefing up support in the barangay level, they are working on the premise that they would not get the support of the barangay captains because most of them are not allied with BOPK. He made it clear, though, that BOK is not eyeing any political coalitions because it could stand on its own. Ruiz, meanwhile, said he and his groupmates are filing their COCs on Oct. 7 also. As for his runningmate whom he has not revealed yet, he said they would formally announce it during their official proclamation event on Oct. 5, when he would announce his complete slate. Ruiz said his City Council candidates are individuals with ""impeccable character” who share his value system. ""If ga una-una og declare ning ubang grupo that is their choice, but kining atoa, bisan tuod nauwahi ta, we underwent a thorough selection process para ato gyud ni silang mahashasan nga kining mga tawhana ang karapat-dapat sa ilang position,"" he said. Ruiz said they will have the Oct. 5 announcement outside the structure of the Compania Maritima building near the Cebu City Hall.—RHM (CEBU NEWS)"
1,"KAHIT ang matapang at kinatatakutang pinuno ng Communist Party ng Soviet Union na si Nikita Kruschchev ay may sentimyento tungkol sa pulitika:“Iisa lang ang kulay ng lahat ng pulitiko sa buong mundo. Mangangako sila  ng tulay kahit wala namang ilog o dagat na tutulayan. At bakit laging nakakalusot ang mga ganitong klaseng pulitiko? Dahil sa mundo ng pulitika, walang mahigpit na requirement para kumandidato ang isang pulitiko.” “Nakakamtan nila ang isang posisyon  na gabundok ang responsibilidad, kahit hindi man lang sila dumaan sa pagsasanay, hindi nag-master ng anumang kaalaman, walang eksamen na pinagdaanan, o walang diploma o lisensiya na kailangang ipakita.” “Sa kabilang dako, bakit ang isang veterinarian na nanggagamot ng inyong aso at pusa ay hinihingan ng lisensiya bilang pruweba na eksperto siyang  makapagligtas ng buhay ng mga hayop. Pero ang pulitiko na mamamahala ng kabuhayan at buhay ng buong sambayanan ay hindi naman hinihingan ng katibayang nabanggit?” Kaya nga sabi ni Kruschchev, “huwag nang magtaka kung bakit marami sa mga pulitiko na ang alam lang ay ‘magkalat’ at ang iba, magnakaw.” “It is not in the nature of politics that the best men should be elected. The best men do not want to govern their fellowmen.” – George E. MacDonald"
1,"The broad daylight armed robbery of the two jewelry stores in the most crowded area in Cebu City last week highlights the need to reassess the peace and order situation of the city. The incident was so well planned and well executed that in less than one minute, the robbery of the two establishments was consummated. Because the local election is fast approaching, it must challenge those who are running for public office to address in their platforms the public solid perception that illegal drugs and crime are back. They must do something to prevent such incidents from happening in a very highly-urbanized city. I have always said that all the ordinary people want is a peaceful environment. Workers report to work and go back home exhausted just want to close their eyes and rest their backs as they are seated inside a jeepney or bus free from the probability of being robbed. Students, alternately dreadful and hopeful about what the future holds for them, just want to be safe on their way to school and back home or to their boarding houses. This is one of the reasons why some people keep on emphasizing how they miss former president Rody Roa Duterte on the aspect of maintaining peace and order. Read the many comments online, and you will see how the public longs for his brand of leadership. Although there are other aspects of governance where some do not like his style also. The public’s continued support for the Dutertes should teach those who wish to get elected in 2024 a lesson or two: that the people want strong leadership that will be unforgiving against drugs and crime. The people have long dismissed this “new strategy” (whatever that means) hype in dealing with illegal drugs and crimes. Press releases do not solve problems. Concrete actions do. They saw with their own eyes during Duterte’s leadership what actually worked, which was to put fear in the hearts of the drug lords, pushers, protectors, and criminals. However, there are those who do not like such a style also. Locally, the voters of Cebu City push those who aspire to lead the city to take a stronger stand against drugs and criminality. They must all present to the voters a clear roadmap in solving the problem. People are tired of slogans and motherhood statements. As of this writing, one suspect in the robbery has been arrested. Getaway vehicles have been recovered. Authorities identified the robbers as the Parojinog group, also known as the Kuratong Baleleng, a long-time notorious group based in Mindanao. Four of them are from Mindanao, and the rest are local contacts. I commend our police officers for their tireless efforts. May this crime be solved sooner to send a message to criminals that crime does not pay. On a positive note, we are thankful that no innocent civilian was killed when the robbery occurred. Criminality should be decisively crushed. There should be no ifs and buts about that."
1,"Tapus sa pila ka adlaw nga speculation, niining pagbalik ni kanhi Mayor Tom sa politika, karon nga naklaro na ang lineup sa BOPK, magsugod na ang kisaw sa politika sa dakbayan. Kahibawo man ta nga kining eleksiyon sa atong nasud, usa ka dakung kalingawan sa politika, diin tanang matang sa personalidad, lakip ang mga active campaigners ang mosalida. Actually, usa ka serious matter ang eleksiyon, tungod kay may kalabutan man kini sa ugma sa atong nasud, in general, ug sa local nga pagpangagamhanan. Apan, pinasikad sa mga paagi sa kampanya, ug sa unod sa mga pakigpulong nga pulos mga saad, malingaw usab kita. Anyway, ang umaabot nga bugnong lugaynon sunod tuig, gisugdan sa BOPK. Sa inyo nang nasayran, it’s a Councilor Nestor Archival Sr. and former mayor Tommy Osmeña tandem. Samtang ang ubang pundok, medyo hugon-hugon pa lang. Although, giingon dinhi nga sila si Mayor Mike Rama ug kanhi Customs Commissioner Yogi Felimon Ruiz, mipadayag na sa ilang intensiyon pagdagan pagka-mayor sa dakbayan sa Sugbo. Sa ato pa si Archival maoy ikatulo nga modagan pagka-city mayor, sa pagkakaron. ""Witnessed by my friends and elders in the BOPK family, and all of you as witnesses, that I am accepting the challenge, to run as the mayoral candidate for the BOPK family and you (former Mayor Tom) as the vice mayor of the same team,"" nagkanayon si Archival sa iyang pagdawat sa challenge. Gipahibawo usab ang mga nominees unya sa duha ka city congressional districts, sila si kanhi Congressman, Rodrigo “Bebot” Abellanosa, sa South, ug incumbent Councilor Mary Ann de los Santos, sa North. Samtang wala pa ang filing of certificates of candidacy, ug ang official campaign period, apan, alegre na. Sugod na ang kalingawan. Medyo gabukal na ang kaldera sa politika sa siyudad. * * * Karon sa pagpadayon sa atong 'leadership series' dinhi, una sa tanan, atong pahinumdom nga ayaw, dula-dulai, ayaw i-negosyo ang balaan nga katungod sa pagpili. Vote wisely and responsibly. Ang internet nagkanayon: You’re the voice: It’s our responsibility to vote wisely. Bitaw, ikaw ang tingog sa lungsod. Ang imong desisyon karon (as you vote), mao nay mahimong dalan (asa kita paingon as a nation/city or as a province) ang ug unsaon paglambo. Ingon niini ang pagka-bililhon sa imong single vote. Dugang pa: “Vote wisely to elect good leaders, reduce corruption. Being a citizen of this part of the world’s biggest democracy it is not only our right but a responsibility to elect the right set of people.” Dili nato katungod lamang ang pagbotar wisely, kundili, katungdanan gayud ang pagpili sa matarong ug kasaligan nga mga leader. Sa ato pa, kon unsa karon ang atong mga leader, efficient o inefficient ba, mag-agad kini giunsa nimo paggamit ang imong katungod ug katungdanan pagpili. Pangutana sa internet: What does ‘vote wisely’ mean? Ikaw, unsay imong sabut niini? Dili ka makatubag sa husto tungod kay wala ka gayud maka-vote wisely sukad. Anyway, ania: “Vote your conscience in the primary and then vote the best overall option in the election. Be informed, don't vote based on the news and on popularity."
1,"For the longest time, Philippine politics is neither based on ideology nor principles, but on dominant personalities and groups of temporary allies who wield power, dispense favors and control public funds and the apportionment of prerogatives, privileges and money. Thus it remains feudal, paternalistic, transactional and opportunistic. Filipinos go into politics for personal gains, power, prestige and for financial aggrandizement. Therefore, this country is doomed to mediocrity and the people are condemned to suffer in perpetual poverty, social injustice and social unrest. Aguinaldo was a feudal landlord, Quezon was an Ilustrado and Osmeña belonged to the elite in Cebu. The Laurels were among the elite in Batangas and Roxas was a scion of the De Leon landed gentry in Bulacan and the landlords in Capiz. Quirino belonged to the elite in Vigan. Only Magsaysay really came from the ""masa” and perhaps Macapagal. But Magsaysay married the transport heiress from Bataan and Macapagal married the rich and landed Eva Macaraeg of Pangasinan. The Marcoses, Aquinos, Ramoses, Estrada, GMA, and even Duterte were all elites. No one was a scion of a farmer or a squatter from Tondo or Pasil. Feudalism in Philippine politics is shown by the manner by which landed families dominate politics, like the hacienderos in Negros, controlling political powers to protect their financial and business interests. Feudalism comes from the French word 'feodalisme' taken from the Latin term feodom, which means feudal monarchs, feudal lords, who dominate both the economy and the politics of a given territory. Feudalism centers on vassalage, homage and fiefdom. Power does not reside in the people but they who control the source of money control necessarily the source of power. Benedict Anderson, an Irish-American political scientist, called the Philippine political system as a cacique democracy. It has never changed from the time of Aguinaldo to BBM. Paternalism emphasizes on the so-called moral obligation of the controlling elite to dispense favors to the poor masses or the working class. This is the concept of ""noblesse oblige"" or the ethical responsibility of the ""maharlika"" landlords and economic elite to distribute ""ayudas"" to the poverty-stricken ""aliping namamahays"" and ""aliping saguiguilids."" This was illustrated by Dr. Jose Rizal in Noli and Fili where Capitan Tiago represented the oppressive, coercive and exploitative elite and Padre Damaso reflected how the Church used the teachings of God to subjugate the ignorant, the powerless and voiceless ""hoi polloi"" represented by Sisa, Crispin and Basilio. The mental derangement of Sisa was a figure of speech to show the malignant socio-economic decay of the country's political, economic and social situations. The padrino system is shown how powerful families intermarry to preserve the monopoly of power. The marriage between two Marcoses (BBM and Irene) to the Aranetas are palpable evidence that in this country, even love, romance and marriage can be arranged to preserve domination of both the economy and politics. I recall the historic unification of the hitherto political enemies: the Quibranzas of Lanao del Norte and the Dimaporos of Lanao del Sur.  The union of two political clans in Lanao assured their domination of both the politics and the economy in that Muslim territory. This spectacle is repeated in all provinces in the country. The pattern is the same. That is why the Khos control Masbate, the Defensors, Garins and other elite control Iloilo, and so on. I do not have to mention Cebu because we all know what is prevalent. In the Philippines, a poor boy can only rise in the nation's totem pole if he is a handsome actor, a gifted scholar from Harvard or a husband of a landed heiress if he is not a drug lord, a glib tongue religious pastor and appointed son of God, a Pogo dummy of foreign predators or a rice smuggler. Salvation in this country emanates from physical attributes, high education or being an action star, a crime or political warlord. All the rest should accept their fate as laborers, servants, construction workers, prostitutes or beggars. The truth hurts but that is the true state of the nation which no president would dare to tell the people."
1,"TATLUMPU’T PITONG taon na nating nilalabag ang ating Konstitusyon na nagbabawal sa paghahalal sa serbisyo publiko ng magkakamag-anak. Sang-ayon sa Article 2, Section 26 ng 1987 Constitution, ipinagbabawal ng estado ang mga political dynasties batay sa mga probisyon ng batas. Ito ang malaking problema, simula nang umiral ang 1987 Constitution, wala pang napagtitibay na batas para ipatupad ang pagbabawal sa political dynasties. May mga naghain na ng mga panukalang-batas pero walang isa man lamang ang nakarating sa ikalawang pagbasa, sa Kamara man o sa Senado. Hindi otomatik ang pag-iral ng pagbabawal sa political dynasties, kailangang magpasa ng batas ang Kongreso tungkol dito. Hindi naman mahirap isipin kung bakit walang naipapasang batas, sapagkat ang magpapasa ng batas ay galing mismo sa mga political dynasties. Sa halip na mabawasan, lalong dumarami ang magkakamag-anak na naihahalal sa Kongreso. Maraming malalapit na magkamag-anak sa Kamara. Sa Senado, may mga Senador na magkakapatid at mag-ina.  Sa darating na eleksyon sa isang taon, posibleng may mahalal namang mag-aama. Ganyan rin sa ehekutibo. Simula noong 1988 hanggang 2019, ay ganito ang naging takbo. Sa gobernador, 80% ay magkakamag-anak; sa bise-gobernador, 68%; sa mayor, 53%. Ayon pa rin sa mga pag-aaral, marami sa mga probinsiya, munisipalidad o lunsod na pinamumunuan ng magkakamag-anak ay nananatiling mahirap, kung ihahambing sa mga lugar na walang political dynasties. Bakit? Kasi, sa political dynasties ay sila-sila na lang, walang bagong mga kaisipan, walang masyadong pagpupursigi, at walang mahigpit na checks and balances na nauuwi sa katiwalian. May pag-asa pa ba tayo? May dalawang petisyong nakahain sa Korte Suprema para obligahin ang Kongreso na magpasa na ng batas laban sa political dynasties. May mga eksperto sa batas ang nagsasabing walang kapangyarihan ang Korte Suprema na gawin ito. At parang pelikula, to the rescue ang bida, si Senator Robinhood Padilla, tagapangulo ng Senate Committee on Constitutional Amendments and Revision of Codes. Inihain niya ang Senate Bill 2730 na naglalayong ipinatupad ang mandato ng Konstitusyon na nagbabawal sa political dynasties. Sa panukalang-batas ay ipinagbabawal ang pagtakbo sa anumang posisyon sa katulad na halalan ng asawa o kamag-anak ng isang incumbent sa munisipalidad, siyudad o probinsya, at maging sa party list.  Sa totoo lang, hinangaan ko rito si Senator Robinhood.  Pero ang tanong, makakapasa kaya ang kanyang panukala? May isa pang paraan, huwag ihalal ang magkakamag-anak. Sana’y magising na ang mga botanteng Pilipino. Tayo rin ang may kagagawan bakit tayo nagkakaganito. Tayo rin ang may kasalanan bakit nakapamamayagpag sa kapangyarihan ang magkakamag-anak. Sabi ni Albert Einstein, “Ang lakas ng Konstitusyon ay nakadepende sa determinasyon ng bawat isang mamamayan na ipaglaban ito. Mapapangalagaan lamang ang mga karapatang Konstitusyonal kung bawat mamamayan ay gagawin ang kanyang tungkulin na ito’y ipaglaban.” Walang may monopolyo ng kagalingan at kahandaang makisangkot sa serbisyo publiko. Sana, bago maghalalan sa Mayo 2025 ay mayroon na tayong batas na nagbabawal sa political dynasties.  Dahil kung magbabagal-bagal pa tayo, baka isang araw ay gigising tayo na ang Presidente natin at Bise Presidente ay mag-asawa, mag-ama o mag-ina. At ang ating mga senador at kongresista ay magkakapatid at magpipinsang-buo. Ang serbisyo-publiko ay hindi dapat gawing pampamilyang-negosyo!"
1,"KONTAMINADO ng korapsyon ang pamayanan natin dahil sa pulitika. Karamihan ng campaign contributors, iligalistang bumibili ng proteksyon.

1,"In a column I wrote early last month, I tried understanding the value of a two party system of American politics. These are the Republicans and Democrats. The fact is that these two parties dominate US elections. The little I have learned from the internet is that the Republican philosophy leans more towards individual freedoms, rights and responsibilities while in contrast, Democrats attach greater importance to equality and social/community responsibility. The intense pursuit of the two regularly opposing Republican and Democrat political thoughts makes American politics dynamic that attempts to form such third parties as the Libertarian, Constitution, Green, Natural Law and Reform Parties have either been stymied or lethargic. I reported though in that June column that the Libertarian Party, the more active American third group, has selected Chase Russell Oliver as its presidential bet in the coming US presidential elections. I made that observation in my humble attempt to paint a different political scene in our city since the grant of Philippine independence on July 4, 1946 (what a coincidence as today is July 4) by America thru the Hare-Hawes-Cutting and the Tydings-McDuffy Acts. I said then that there have been NO two political parties espousing different principles hereabouts. The seeds of political thoughts appeared to be sowed ONLY by the Osmeña family, mainly former Senator Sergio “Serging” Osmeña Jr. Serging surged to power despite the derogatory claim that he was a Japanese collaborator in the second world war. Even with that supposed stain in his name, he was heralded as Nino Bonito, an unchallenged king pin of sort, in Cebu politics. There were men who worked in his shadows and fleetingly took the city mayorship. I recall such learned people as Atty. Carlos Cuizon, Atty. Mario Ortiz, Atty. Luis Diores, Engr. Eulogio Borres and Atty. Ronald Duterte. Their individual brilliance was, however, blunted by the doctrinaire imposition of Serging’s political philosophy. They were surrogates of Sen Osmeña, Jr., so to speak. Dr. Florentino Solon, a man of otherwise different political mind, proved to be a good mayor but he was more perceived as an attempt of the Marcos’ martial law to put a different hue to the military regime among Cebuanos. Mayor Jose Cuenco, being only an OIC, did not have enough time to show his leadership worth. Tomas de la Rama Osmeña, became city mayor and really stepped into the shoes of his father, Serging. Naturally, he kept the Osmeña political philosophy intact. Succeeding mayors in Atty. Alvin Garcia and Atty. Michael Rama, began their careers suited in Bando Osmeña colors and continued to promote the Osmeña mind. This political scene in Cebu City is, to say the least, sad. Our city is home to many bright minds. To cite one indicator, we need only to read the results of licensure examinations. Almost always, the top 10 finishers include Cebuano names necessarily not related to the Osmeñas. In another point, men and women leading the country’s giant private corporations are Cebuanos without Osmeña blood in their veins, no offense to this honorable family name. Cebu bred accountants, architects, doctors, engineers, lawyers and other professionals with different family names are acknowledged to be the top practitioners of their professions. Yet, none of them is seen involved in the elective service to the people. Cebuano politics does not benefit from the wisdom of these gifted professionals. The brilliant people I refer to dare not attempt to offer themselves to elective positions because we Cebuano electors are conditioned to vote for candidates educated in the Osmeña political thought. Our collective challenge is to push the bright people in our midst to seek elective position and support them with no other objective than to reinvent the city governance."
1,"CEBU,  Philippines — In politics, “anything can happen.” This was the response of suspended Cebu City Mayor Michael Rama when asked on the possibility of him endorsing acting Vice Mayor Donaldo “Dondon” Hontiveros as the next mayor of the city, if not his running mate in the 2025 elections. Although hesitant to respond to inquiries made by the media yesterday after receiving an award from the Office of the Vice President led by Vice President Sara Duterte herself, Mayor Rama said he already told Hontiveros that politics is “formless” or anything goes. “Actually, anything can happen. In politics, I’m telling Dondon let’s all look at it formless,” Rama said. “Anything goes, because what really matters is nation-building. What really matters for me is one Cebu Island, so you are part of One Cebu island,” added Rama. In previous interviews before he was suspended, both Rama and acting mayor Raymond Alvin Garcia have confirmed that they will continue to be a tandem in the next election. However, following Rama's suspension, both officials have also said their relationship has changed, with the former criticizing Garcia for his decisions as acting mayor. For Rama and Hontiveros, both have been visibly seen more together on several occasions from official functions, even after the mayor's suspension. Rama said he admires Hontiveros for his support as others are seemingly keeping a distance from him. “Pero magkuyog mi pirmi no, kabantay mo? Didto mis SRP (prayer rally led by former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte) kami gihapon. Unya kadtong pag presscon (last Thursday), kami gihapon. Dili man ni mahadlok, puro man gud mi mga basketball player, kabalo mi mu pasa pasa sa among kaugalingon…player-coach. Kaming duha, we have the spirit of sportsmanship, win some, lose some,” Mayor Rama said. Rama added that he actually wanted Hontiveros to receive the award from the OVP on behalf of the Cebu City government, but was told by organizers that it should be him, and Hontiveros did not mind not going up the stage. “With the acting vice Mayor — Mayor, Vice Mayor, what not… the future of this young man is so bright. Very very bright and I'm very proud. I was downstairs and I was looking for him so that when I'm entering I'll be with him. You know what I mean? I can't be alone without this man. Been with me in troubles, in jubilation, in any kind of move. He has always been around, which I'm very proud of,” Rama shared. As for Hontiveros, he stressed that his support for Rama stays the same. “As I mentioned before, I've always been a team player, unsay directions sa atong leader, atong elder, it has always been team direction,” Hontiveros said. Should Rama endorse him to run as mayor or the latter’s running mate as vice mayor, or for any other position, Hontiveros said he will be ready for it. “Yes boy scout, maninguha ta to be ready. But again, whatever is the direction. Dakong hagit? Di sad ko maka ingon kay naa may guidance,” Hontiveros added. (CEBU NEWS)"
1,"The announcement of VP Sara that her father and brothers will run for the Senate next year is just the political family expressing its disgust with national politicians. Sige kayo…inapi ninyo si Sara sa Manila. Magdusa kayo sa tatlong Duterte sa Senado. Not only that, the very obviously unqualified youngest brother will run for President in 2028 daw. That’s how toxic, destructive and totally irrelevant to national development our politics can be. A dynastic family feels they have a majority of the people at their beck and call and they are betting everything to get back the national political power they have learned to enjoy and abuse. The sad part is, they could be right. Only a Tulfo may save us from a Duterte, if you can consider that being saved. For many of our people, it doesn’t matter that the first Duterte reign was a disaster that set us back more years than the nation can afford. But it is hopeless that we are talking or worrying about this plot of the Duterte family to get back to Malacanang when we have a crisis in education to work on. Well, at least VP Sara is out of DepEd so we can start repairing the institution. That wouldn’t have been possible with her at DepEd. Good things won’t start to happen unless BBM appoints a really capable DepEd Secretary. He or she must not be a politician unless of the statesman mold and we do not have too many of those. A good rule of thumb for BBM to use is, if the person is actively campaigning to be appointed, that’s not the right one. There were some suggestions that former VP Leni Robredo be appointed. That would be seen as a unification of political rivals for the sake of the country. Good optics for BBM. But it is a bad idea for Leni. It is a no win situation for her. If she does well as I think she would, even the allies of the President with ambitions to succeed him will get jealous. They will put obstacles to ensure her failure. Besides, the problem at DepEd is so bad you need more than a half term to register noticeable improvements. At best, the massive bleeding can be controlled but PISA scores won’t show improvements just yet. It may require at least a decade of doing the right things before we can say we are on the right trajectory. So, no Leni for DepEd. Perhaps a low key person with exposure to our educational problems will be better. Two names come to mind. Dr. Vic Limlingan and Milwilda Guevarra. Dr. Limlingan is a Harvard educated economist and former professor at the Asian Institute of Management. He has been involved in helping some LGUs: Makati, Antipolo and Pasig with improving outcomes in the basic education of their constituents. Dr. Vic has even organized a Foundation to study options in improving such educational outcomes by introducing targeted reforms. His management expertise is essential in running DepEd’s million strong bureaucracy. Best of all, he has no political ambitions, given his age. Former finance undersecretary Milwilda Guevarra was so interested in doing her share to educate our youth that she established the Synergia Foundation after she retired from DOF. Her work with Synergia brought her into contact with many LGU leaders and DepEd officials at the local level. She knows what ails the system better than many education PhDs who have been stuck in academic ivory towers. Indeed, Ms Guevarra shifted her efforts somewhat to helping feed pre- schoolers and those in kindergarten because she knows unless those young brains develop properly before age five, it will be tough for them to learn anything in the higher grades. If a politician is desired, it will have to be a low key one who has a track record in studying the problems of the education sector. The name that comes to mind is Pasig Rep. Roman Romulo. He has consistently immersed himself in the education sector without the publicity that most politicians crave for. He is very much in his family’s tradition for public service, following the footsteps of his father, former senator Alberto Romulo and his uncle, Carlos P. Romulo. In a sense he isn’t your typical politician but knows enough of the system to navigate it well. I heard some past UP presidents are also interested. Problem is, there has been no recent UP president who seems worthy of the Cabinet position. Sadly, the presidency of UP has been politicized in recent years. No more OD Corpuzes or Dodong Nemenzos or Emil Javier or Noel Soriano. Indeed, the UP faculty had been at odds with those who had been UP presidents in recent years. In any case, whoever BBM picks, the first order of business is to work with DSWD to feed the very young kids. Then, a vigorous program of training teachers must be undertaken specially for Math and Science. I recently mentioned to a Singapore Embassy official that they should consider helping train our teachers in math. My grandchildren are currently benefiting from the good educational system in Singapore. Maybe we can expose our teachers to how they do it so well in Singapore. Where do we get the money to improve education? DepEd already has the largest budget. Maybe if we plug the leakages and spend more efficiently, we will have better results. A good DepEd Secretary can make that happen. Right now education is our number one crisis. I hope BBM and Congress realize that. Our country’s future is at stake. And that’s no exaggeration. We have no time for toxic politics. Boo Chanco’s email address is [email protected] Follow him on X @boochanco."
1,"Maghisgot kita’g panabako o panigarilyo, alang sa kaugmaon sa atong mga anak. Politika?  Ambot naunsa na sila didto sa kaulohan, nga na-affected ra ba kita dinhi, labi na ang mga LGUs ug ang mga district congressmen nga mao ra’g maglisud sila’g lihok sa ilang kaugalingon. Anyway, huwat lang ta, sa final nga mga panghitabo. Hinaut nga mahusay ra sila didto, ug dili modaghan ang mga local executives nga suspensohon. Yes, haring lungsod, sayud kitang tanan sa dautang epekto sa pagpanabako. Apan, ato lang kining gipiyogan, gi-take for granted, o gipakibali-wala, nga karon dili na ikaptingala kon makakita’g mga babaye ug mga bata nga manigarilyo. Common sight na kini karon. Sa among panahon (many, many years ago), wala kini. Ato kining kutluon: “Filipinos are warned of a tremendous price of smoking in terms of lives, lost prematurely; diminished health; increased in tobacco-related illnesses; disability; decreased productivity and the associated economic consequences.” Grabe no? Dihay gipasiugdahan sa una nga signature campaign giulohan ‘Orchids for Astray Movement,’ ug ‘Be Smart, Don’t Ever Start – Maging Matalino, Iwas ang Manigarilyo’ Movement. Ambut unsay nahitabo adto. Dugay man kaayo to. Dihay kampanya ang World Health Organization (WHO) ginganlang og ‘It’s Okay to Say You Mind,’ pag-empower sa mga non-smokers pagbarug, “to stand up for their right to clean, smoke-free air.” Katungod unta kini sa dili manabako, nga kanunay ma-exposed sa kapin 4,000 ka harmful substances nga anaa sa sigarilyo. Apan, nganong manigarilyo man gyud? Giingon dinhi, smoking is associated with prominence, fame (ilado ka, bantugan ka), masculinity, machismo (tunay nga lalake konohay), freedom, liberation  (gawasnon ka,walay makabuot nimo unsay imong buhaton). Dugang niini, mao ang socio-cultural influence, diin ang panigarilyo accepted na sa katilingban. Sa personal nga katuyoan, naglakip sa self-esteem, self-image, aduna kay, disposable, o mahimong ilabay nga income. Apan, matud pa, ‘the truth is that smoking is now one of the world’s leading causes of death, recording an average of 3.5 million cases every day.’ Ambut pila na kaha kini karon, nga nagkadaghan man kono ang hinigarilyo. Pagkakaron, adunay mga 1.1 billion ka smokers sa tibuok kalibutan, mga 82% niini, nagpuyo sa middle-income countries (Pilipinas?). Target karon aron mas modaghan ang manigarilyo, mao ang kababayen-an ug kabataan. Akong tan-aw, daku nilang garbo ang pagpanigarilyo, sama sa ilang makita sa mga movies. Ang Department of Health (DOH) mibutyag nga “one of every three Filipino adults smokes.” Ngilngiga nato uy, dili sad ta magpalupig, as far as panigarilyo is concerned. Dugang pa, padayon sa DOH: “What smokers do not know is that tobacco can cause about 25 life-threatening diseases, or group of diseases,” nga daghan niini mahimo untang kalikayan sa hingtungdan kon mobiya sa pagpanigarilyo. Mga 20,000 kuno ka Pilipino ang mamatay matag tuig, gumikan sa smoking-related diseases. Pila na kaha kini karon, nga dugay na man kining clipping nga atong gibasihan ning atong gihisgutan karon. Ug nia pa “In the worldwide level, a person dies every 8 seconds from tobacco. Sa umaabot nga katuigan, “it is predicted that tobacco will become the leading cause of death and disability.”"
1,NACIONALISTA PARTY ang kauna-unahang political party sa Pilipinas na itinatag noong 1907 na naging Partido ni Pres. Manuel Quezon noong 1944-1946. Itinatag naman ang Liberal Party noong 1946 nina Manuel Roxas at Elpidio Quirino at kapwa sila naging presidente. Nabago ang lahat nang ideklara ni Ferdinand Marcos Sr. ang martial law at nanghina ang lahat na partido political na kalaban ng Marcos administration. Itinatag ni Marcos Sr. noong 1978 ang Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (KBL) na binuo ng mga datihang LP at NP members. Itinatag naman ni Sen. Benigno Aquino Jr. ang partidong Lakas ng Bayan (LABAN) na binansagang makakaliwa at sinundan ni Sen. Nene Pimentel sa pagtatatag ng Partido Demokratiko Pilipino (PDP). Naengganyo ang mga maimpluwesyang pamilya at mga organisasyon sa iba’t ibang panig ng bansa para magtatag ng sari-sariling political party na ang intensiyon ay magpayaman lang. Lalong nagulo at nagpalala ng korapsyon ang multi-party system dahil sa pinagkakaperahang political coalition na umuuwi sa kutsabahan sa paglulustay ng pera ng bayan. Mabuti pang ibalik na muli ang labanan sa pulitika sa pagitan ng dalawang partido politikal para madaling malaman ang mga pulitikong bulok sa hindi nabubulok.
1,"Whoever wishes to enter politics should learn a lesson or two from the most recent shakeup in the Philippine Senate. It had elements of drama, and as the plot thickened, those unfamiliar with politics could only shake their heads. One of the intriguing aspects of Sen. Migz Zubiri's removal as Senate president --now replaced with Sen. Chiz Escudero-- is the role of Sen. Ronald ""Bato"" dela Rosa. Of course, you must be completely naïve to remove Malacañang from the picture. Whoever sits as the president of this country would always try to influence the two houses of Congress in the area of leadership. That's plain as day. It was a twist that caught everyone, especially Zubiri, off guard. Dela Rosa, who had been perceived as being on Zubiri's side, was seen on national television shedding tears during Zubiri's emotional privilege speech. Yet, it was Dela Rosa who, unexpectedly, became the 15th senator to sign the petition to oust Zubiri. Many believed that one of the reasons why Zubiri was removed was because he allowed Dela Rosa to investigate PDEA leak, which allegedly linked President Bongbong Marcos to drugs. Many speculate that on Malacañang’s part, it was the last straw that broke the camel's back. Another reason cited is that Zubiri has done nothing to push for the move to amend the Constitution through the Peoples Initiative. In other words, Zubiri took the bullets for Dela Rosa. The latter did not return the favor. One would think that Zubiri, being a veteran politician, would treat his removal as just another day for any politician and that he has long ago come to terms with the possibility that he would be removed anytime. But he is just a human being who also feels the sting of betrayal or what he feels to be a betrayal. “Alam mo. I thought I’ve seen strange things in my political career, and this happens to be the strangest,” he was quoted as saying, adding, “kung kahapon ako po ay heartbroken; ngayon po ako dumbfounded.” Dela Rosa, on the other hand, gave a justification for his action. He said, “Among us tatlo magka-batch na PDP senators, we forged a covenant na majority wins in every voting situation.” All for one, one for all. He apologized to Zubiri for failing to convince his fellow PDP senators. “Gusto ko sabihin kay Migz doon, is ‘sorry boss, I failed to win the war for you’.” Dela Rosa also said that his signature was insignificant because the required number had already been obtained to remove Zubiri. But if his signature was insignificant, why did he affix it in the first place? What will happen next? Will Chiz Escudero bow down to the whims and caprices of Malacañang, and up to what extent? We don’t know. All we can do is look at the history of the Philippine Senate. In my view, to a respectable degree and on many occasions, the Senate has shown independence from Malacañang. It has generally been its mark, and that fact becomes more punctuated if you compare it with the Lower House. Each senator is not called a senator of the republic for nothing. Let’s wish for the best under Sen. Escudero's leadership."
1,"Adunay duha ka dagway ang politika, maayo ug dautan. Ako kining gituki tungod kay gisugyot sa presidente sa Cebu City Association of Barangay Councils ug Kapitan sa Barangay Kasambagan Franklin Ong nga ang paghatag og tabang pinansiyal ngadto sa 80 ka Barangay sa dakbayan sa Sugbo ipalayo sa maniubra sa politika ug inpluwensiya. Kini human giawhag ni Ong ang iyang mga kaubanan sa konseho atol sa ilang session niadtong Mayo 15 nga ipagawas na ang salapi nga gigahin alang sa 80 ka mga Barangay sa dakbayan. Apan giklaro ni Konsehal James Anthony Cuenco nga ang pulong “Barug” sa Resolution nga gisumitir ni Ong nagpasabot na nga adunay kolor politika sa paghatag sa tabang pinansiyal. Ang lokal nga kagamhanan sa dakbayan sa Sugbo migahin og P400 milyones sa tuig 2024 niining gahin alang sa tabang pinansiyal sa 80 ka Barangay. Sa memorandum nga gipagawas ni Mayor Mike Rama nga naglatid sa patakaran sa paggamit sa tabang pinansiyal nakasentro sa direksiyon sa patakaran nga iyang gitawag og “Barug Cebu City.” Giingon sa mga konsehal nga ang Barug nagpasabot kini sa Partido Barug nga ang nagtukod og Presidente si Mayor Mike Rama. Kadaghanan sa mga konsehal kauban sa mayor sa miaging eleksiyon. Giawhag ni Cuenco si konsehal Franklin Ong sa pagpapas sa pulong Barug sa gisumitir niining Resolution. Iyang gipasabot nga ang pundo sa gobyerno kinahanglan nga dili magduso og partido politikal. Apan gipasabot ni konsehal Franklin Ong ug konsehal Joy Pesquera nga ang pulong “Barug” acronym lamang nga aprobado na sa Executive Legislative Agenda (ELA). Gisugyot ni Pesquera nga usbon ang ELA nga giaprobahan niadtong 2022 kun usbon man gyod ang pulong “Barug.” Giklaro usab ni konsehal Rey Gealon nga ang memorandum sa mayor wala maghisgot og politika gani ang tanang 80 ka Barangay ang makadawat niini. Busa wala kini jolor sa politika. Gipasabot ni Ong unsay ipasabot sa “Barug” nga agenda nga ang “B” business environment and employment opportunities, “A” adequate water supply, “R” resettlement and housing, “U” urban and upland development ug ang “G” good governance, public safety and resiliency. Maayo kini nga dagway sa politika."

1,"It took quite a long time before the long arm of the law caught up with expelled Negros Oriental lawmaker Arnulfo Teves Jr. in Timor Leste. His arrest last week is further proof that if there's a will, the law can extend far and wide to enforce justice. This is not to say that Teves is already guilty of the charges against him. Under the Constitution, he is presumed innocent until proven otherwise. It simply means that a court of law has found enough evidence for the charges to proceed to trial. Given the very serious nature of the multiple murder charges, the accused is ordered to remain within the law’s physical reach --in other words, under detention. Meanwhile, Pastor Apollo C. Quiboloy, leader of the Philippine-based Kingdom of Jesus Christ church, remains free as of this writing. To be clear, no court has issued a warrant for his arrest, at least until such time as the courts, to which the Department of Justice has recommended filing charges of sexual abuse and qualified human trafficking, find probable cause for his arrest and detention. However, the Senate and House of Representatives have already issued arrest orders against Quiboloy. The order from the Senate stems from Quiboloy’s refusal to testify at the inquiry led by Senator Risa Hontiveros into alleged cases of human trafficking, child abuse, sexual abuse, and violence within Quiboloy’s church. Meanwhile, the House of Representatives issued an arrest warrant against Quiboloy following a contempt citation for his failure to attend any of the six hearings on alleged franchise violations by Sonshine Media Network International (SMNI). I mention the cases of Teves and Quiboloy to underline the evident double standards powerful people use in navigating the legal processes in our country. During the presidency of Quiboloy’s closest ally, former president Rodrigo Duterte, SMNI, the TV network associated with Quiboloy’s church, condemned various critics for allegedly skirting the rule of law and defying the Constitution in opposing the government. Similarly, Teves, during his time in Congress was known to be close to the policemen in the province. As a lawmaker, he had also sworn an oath to uphold the rule of law. Now that Quiboloy and Teves are facing legal scrutiny, all sorts of reasons have been put forward in an apparent attempt to gain sympathy and skirt the legal processes. Previously, they demonstrated faith in these processes, but now they seemingly have none. Again, we are not discussing the guilt or innocence of the parties involved at this point. We are simply focusing on the legal processes that should apply equally to all Filipinos, without exception. The bizarre twist in Quiboloy’s case is the kind of support he is receiving from respectable members of the political elite. Senator Cynthia Villar expressed her puzzlement (nagtataka) over all the allegations against Quiboloy, stating that he is a friend and has been good to her family. This, she said, makes her not really believe the allegations against him. Senator Robinhood Padilla defended Quiboloy, arguing against prejudging him as guilty in the committee inquiry. Their arguments make no sense because no one is seeking to outright condemn or prejudge Quiboloy at this moment. Both Teves and Quiboloy are merely being required to face the legal processes, whether before our legislative bodies or the courts. The justifications we are hearing from some powerful people defending Quiboloy reveal our country’s descent into brazen, transactional “quid pro quo” politics: “If you support me, I’ll support you”, regardless of the rule of law."

1,"Politics can impact business in a number of ways, and significantly at that. According to Harvard Business School professor Forest Reinhardt, the government has four basic functions: first, protecting citizens from external harm; second, protecting them from internal threats; third, protecting property rights; and third, creating means of resolving disputes. How governments fulfill these responsibilities significantly impacts business. Political leaders often make decisions that impact labor laws, education, transportation and taxes, which in turn, influence business. And while politics can benefit businesses by creating value, Reinhardt pointed out that it can also interfere with value creation. He noted that one of the primary challenges business organizations encounter is corruption. The ability to influence businesses can allow officials to take advantage of their power. And there are three primary forms of corruption in government, according to Reinhardt. These are: extortion where public officials use their power to obtain wealth through threats or force; theft which involves public officials appropriating government assets for personal gain; and capture, where firms pay government officials to influence political decision-making for profit. Reinhardt explained that the primary form of corruption that influences businesses is capture. There are instances, he said, where corrupt companies influence political decisions for their benefit, giving them a clear competitive advantage. He advised that in mergers or acquisitions, it is important to examine a company’s history for signs of corruption. If it is found that a business’s success couldn’t have been achieved without corruption, then it is a sign for the acquiring company to steer clear. Meanwhile, an article in The Economic Times emphasized that the business sector is heavily influenced by a plethora of variants of non-economic elements, with political influences being among the most important of them. It said that laws, rules, and policies are all crafted by governments, and they can have direct or indirect effects on enterprises. And the capacity of companies to function efficiently in a country can be negatively impacted by factors such as political instability and corruption. But businesses also have a powerful influence on politics. An article for the Network for Business Sustainability explained that businesses help determine government priorities, the content of laws and regulations, who gets elected and how the public views issues. Businesses lobby, issue public statements, join coalitions and influence employees’ political engagement. It also pointed out that businesses, and business executives are also a significant source of money in politics. In the US, they account for roughly 60 percent of political contributions and fuel some of the largest “dark money” groups. Are business and politics strange bedfellows or are they inevitable allies? Former South Africa finance minister Nhlanhla Nene stressed that business and politics can never be strange bedfellows but are inseparable twins. But how the twins live side-by-side is something that is peculiar to the historical circumstances of each nation. He quoted John Meynard Keynes who said that “economic prosperity is excessively dependent on a political and social atmosphere which is congenial to the average businessman.” Nene said that business activity takes place within, and ought to be rooted in a constitutional and political context. Business therefore depends on the legislative and regulatory activities of governments for its prosperity. We can therefore understand the local business community’s keen interest not only in the proposed constitutional amendments but also in the recent awarding by the Commission on Elections of an P18-billion contract for the supply of automated vote counting machines for the 2025 midterm elections to South Korean company Miru Systems and its joint venture partners. These machines are an integral part of the electoral process that will choose the country’s next leaders after all; the leaders who can significantly influence the environment in which businesses operate. The new machines will replace the 97,000 vote counting machines procured from Smartmatic Corp. After 15 years of providing the Comelec with automated voting machines, Smartmatic was not allowed to participate in the FASTrAC project, due to controversies. FASTrac stands for Full Automation System with Transparency Audit/Count. But Smartmatic, in a statement, said that in its 23-year history, it has never been indicted in the US or any other country in connection with any election-related contract. But Miru is not free from criticisms too. According to Comelec chair George Garcia, the special bids and awards committee was aware of allegations of malfunctioning voting machines allegedly involving Miru in past elections in other countries such as in  the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The South Korean company had denied allegations, saying its electoral systems are of international standard. Just the same, observers in the business community were surprised with the speed at which the bidding process played out. From the disqualification of Smartmatic to the awarding of the contract to Miru Systems in just a little over two months, one gets an unsettling sense of an accelerated, abbreviated timeline. Something just doesn’t feel right considering that Miru’s equipment is still in the prototype stage, as revealed in a recent hearing at the House. While Comelec said it conducted end-to-end testing of the prototype machines of Miru, the Election Automation Law of 2007 or Republic Act 9369 mandates the use of tested technology in electoral systems or those used in a prior electoral exercise, so one can help but wonder what this rashness is all about. Philippine democracy deserves better than to be treated as a lab rat for untested technology. The selection of Miru Systems, despite its technical shortcomings, only fuels suspicion and erodes public trust in the electoral system. For comments, email at [email protected]"

Ang tawo nga walay ambisyon, dili modamgo, walay aspiration sa kinabuhi, ang maong tawo, patay. Usa ka maalamon nagkanayon:  When you can no longer dream, you are old; when you have no more dreams, you die  Mao ba? Dili na ba mo-damgo kitang mga senior citizens? Padayon: Dreaming keeps us young and alive. Dreams fill us with hopeful expectation affording us a reason to live.  Atong gi-relate ang dreams with ambition. So, keep dreaming, keep pursuing your ambition. Hinuon, usahay, mo-come in ang greed nga maoy makahatag og dautang ingredients sa atong ambisyon, nga ini'g creep in nganhi sa atong galamhan, mo-lead kini ngadto sa corruption. Busa, giingon dinhi, to lessen or to stop corruption, moderate your greed. Lisud no? Anyway, unsa man gyud ning ambition? Tubag sa internet:  It is an earnest desire for some type of achievement or distinction, as power, honor, fame, or wealth, and the willingness to strive for its attainment. Ug nia:  Too much ambition caused him to be disliked by his colleagues. the object, state, or result desired or sought after: The crown was his ambition.  Taas kaayo ang ambisyon, buot kab-uton ang langit, ug mahimo nang desire for personal advancement. Kining kaguliyang karon sa politika, although this is normal in Philippine politics, kay dili man gayud magkasinabot kitang mga Pinoy, maka-apektar man gud sa pang-alagad lungsodnon. Ug ang lungsod maoy ma-hostage, mapasagdan. Is politics really dirty? Game of the devil kuno. Ang internet nagkanayon:  In everyday life, the term ""politics"" refers to the way that countries are governed, and to the ways that governments make rules and laws to manage the human society properly.  Timan-i: to manage the human society properly. Are we managed properly? Dugang pa:  Politics is the art of government, the exercise of control within the society through the making and enforcement of collective decisions. Ang thesaurus nagkanayon:  Politics is the art of government, administration of public affairs; statesmanship.  Per se, dili dirty ang politika. Gihugaw-hugawan lang kini sa mga politiko (of course, dili ang tanan). Politician. A professional in party politics; office seeker; campaigner, public servant, legislator, statesman. So, both the words  politics  ug  politician, dili dirty. * * * Magpalain ta. Sige gihapon ka g panigarilyo?

1,"Malayo pa naman ang susunod na halalan, pero parang nga­yon pa lang mainit na ang mga nagiging usapin sa pulitika sa bansa. Matindi ang isyung binabato ni dating Pangulong Digong Duterte kay Pangulong Bongbong Marcos, na inakusahan niyang­ adik. Bagama’t dati na itong nabanggit ng dating Pangulo bago pa man ang kampanya sa nakalipas na halalan, ngayon nga ay muli itong binuhay. Linggo nang banggitin ni Digong na alkalde pa lamang siya ng Davao ay nakita na niya ang pangalan ni PBBM sa drug watch list. May hawak pa umano siyang papel at may ebidensiya. Kahapon naman binutata ng Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) ang akusasyon ng dating Pangulo at tiniyak na kailanman ay hindi nakasama sa drug watchlist ang pangalan ng Pangulong Bongbong. Hindi pa yan, binanggit pa ng PDEA na maging sa narco list na inilabas mismo ng adminis­trasyong Duterte noong nanunungkulan ito ay wala ang pangalan ni Marcos. Bilang  tugon naman ni PBBM, sinabi nito na dapat maalagaan ng kanyang mga manggagamot ang kalusugan ng dating  Pangulo. Baka umeepekto na ang side effects ng ‘fentanyl’ sa kalusugan nito. Isa umanong highly addictive at may seryosong side effects ang   naturang gamot kung kaya  nagkakaganyan umano ang dating pangulo. Yan ang mainit na isyu na bumabangon ngayon sa pagitan  ng dati at kasalukuyang Pangulo ng bansa. Sa kabilang banda, tuloy pa rin ang masasabing isyu naman sa pagitan ng dalawang Kapulungan ng Kongreso. Ang  Senado at Kamara , dahil naman sa  isyu ng Charter Change (Chacha). Hindi nga ba’t sinasabing ang Mababang Kapulungan ng Kongreso ang promotor sa pagkalap ng pirma para sa People’s Initiative (PI) para sa Chacha. Sa panig ng Senado, isang reslusyon ang  pinirmahan ng lahat ng mga senador na kumokontra sa PI. May inihahanda ding pagdinig ukol dito ang Senado, na ayon naman sa Kamara ay hindi nila dadaluhan, bagamat may imbitasyon sila dito. Naniniwala ang ilang Kongresista na  ang PI ay karapatan ng taumbayan alinsunod sa Saligang Batas. Wala rin umano silang planong buwagin ang Senado sa isinusulong na reporma sa Konstitusyon. O hindi ba, parang teleserye na naman ang kalagayan ng politika sa bansa, na inabaangan kung ang mga kasunod na mga ‘ pasabog’. Malayu-layu pa ang susunod na halalan, pero parang ang tinutumbok ng ganitong mga iringan eh patungo na nga doon. Sinong mananaig, sinong magtatagumpay, sino ang paniniwalaan ng taumbayan, yan ang mga dapat na abangan."

1,"MABUTI at pinayagan nang makapagpiyansa si dating Senadora Leila de Lima matapos ang pitong taong pagdurusa sa bilangguan dahil sa kasong itinuturing ng iba na hinabi nang maruming politika. Ngunit hindi pa tapos ang laban niya dahil wala pang promulgasyon sa kasong nakasampa sa kanya. Hindi perpekto si De Lima subalit naniniwala akong tapat siya sa sinumpaan tungkulin bilang opisyal na inihalal ng taumbayan. Marami ang naniniwala na siya ay biktima ng pulitikang labis ang karumihan. Marami ang may katanungan: kung matibay ang mga kasong isinampa laban sa kanya,  bakit mabagal ang pagbaba ng hatol? Sa paningin ng iba, mukhang sinasadya na pagdusahin nang matagal sa piitan ang dating senadora. Sana, bilisan ang pag-ikot ng gulong ng hustisya para maibaba na ang karampatang hatol kay De Lima na may kinalaman sa ilegal na droga. Lubhang napakatagal na ng pitong taon para pagdusahin ang isang taong kumalaban sa administrasyong nagsakdal sa kanya. Si De Lima ay mortal na kalaban ni dating Presidente Duterte kahit noong ang huli ay mayor pa ng Davao City. Bilang isang human rights advocate, inupakan ni De Lima ang mga summary executions na nangyayari sa Davao. Sa pananaw ng marami, hindi lang biktima ng marungis na pulitika si De Lima kundi ng naantalang paggagawad ng hustisya na katumbas ng katarungang ipinagkait. “Justice delayed, is justice denied” sabi nga ni yumaong President Ramon Magsaysay. Nauna nang pinawalang sala si De Lima sa ibang kasong isinampa laban sa kanya at ang natitira na lamang ay ang tungkol sa droga. Harinawang ilabas na ng hukuman ang hatol nito para huwag maitanim sa isipan ng mamamayan na ang hustisya sa bansa ay maaaring paikutin ng mga nasa kapangyarihan. Wala na sa poder si Duterte at si Presidente Bongbong Marcos na ang namumuno sa bansa. Inaasahan natin na ang gulong ng katarungan ay iikot na nang tama."
1,NAKAPANININDIG balahibo ang ginagawang kabarubalan ng mga dating magkakakampi na na­ging mahigpit na magkakalabang pulitiko ngayon. Tama ang kasabihang “There is no permanent allies and friends in politics. Hmmm! Maliwanag pa sa sikat ng araw ang dahilan kung bakit sinibak sa pagiging deputy speakers ng Kongreso si dating Pres. Gloria M. Arroyo na ngayon ay Pampanga representative at Davao 3rd district Congressman Isidro Ungab—malapit sila kay VP Sara Duterte. Gigil at walang puknat na benggahan ang resulta kasunod ng planong sulutin si House Speaker Martin Romualdez sa unang sigwada pa lamang ng administrasyon ni PBBM. Malinaw na ang BBM-Sara UniTeam ay para sa pansari­ling interes lamang ng mga walang sawa sa kapangyarihan. Nakakaadik pala ‘yun? Binubugbog ng mga propagandista ang isyu ng bangayan nina ACT Teacher party-list Rep. France Castro at ex-Pres.

1,"There should be no more politics after death. Both Ninoy Aquino and Ferdinand Marcos Sr. are long gone into the Great Beyond. There are no more hatreds in their hearts. They were fraternity brothers in UP, after all. And both of them used to belong to the Liberal Party until events and circumstances divided them and fragmented their respective followers. Yesterday and today, the Marcoses and the Romualdez clans, as well as the pro-Marcoses majority of traditional politicians all troop to the Libingan Ng Mga Bayani near Fort Bonifacio to honor the memory of the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos Sr. The Aquinos and the Cory wing of the Cojuangco clan, as well as pro-opposition politicians and former cabinet members all gather together inside the Manila Memorial Park in Paranaque to pay respect to the iconic Senator Ninoy Aquino, and two late presidents: Cory and Noynoy. Even in death, the Filipinos are divided. The burial sites and the crowds around them indicate that the Filipinos are divided not only by politics, ideology and core principles. We are divided by the hatred and spite that continue to bedevil our hearts. There is no more politics after death but the living continue to be fragmented because they are divided by political loyalties and affiliations. My wife is from Nueva Ecija and she has always been pro-Ninoy since 1983 when the senator was murdered during the Marcos One administration. My wife was a rabid demonstrators and I silently and surreptitiously supported her because I was then connected with the government-owned and controlled PNOC and Petron. During the EDSA revolt, the two of us were in the corner of Ortigas and EDSA near what is now the Blas F. Ople Building that houses the POEA and the Department of Migrant Workers, when it was announced that the Marcoses fled Malacañang Palace and were flown by the US embassy to Hawaii instead of Paoay. We were also outside the airport terminal on August 21, 1983, when then senator Doy Laurel tearfully announced to the people that Ninoy Aquino was dead on the tarmac. When president Marcos Sr. died in Hawaii on September 28, 1989, my wife and I happened to be in Honolulu visiting my parents. My father was a US veteran in the second World War and he was granted American citizenship with my mother and my youngest brother who was below 18 years of age. I dared to visit the wake with my young kids way up there in Makiki Heights where his remains lay in state. I paid my respect because in 1977, Marcos Sr. appointed me Labor Arbiter, although his Martial Law regime caused my arrest and detention in 1972 as a student leader and demonstrator. I opted to go and visit him in Makiki to the great consternation and dismay of my wife. I wanted to show to my young kids that after death, there is no more politics. After death, we have to bury the hatchet and forgive each other’s excesses and deficiencies. After death, we should reconcile and set aside every thing that divides us. My wife could not be persuaded. Then, sometime in the 1990s, when my wife and I were on a European tour, we were in Milan and went inside a shop for neckties, belts and other men's accessories. Lo, and behold, I met the young BBM with his petite lawyer-wife and I made sure I had a picture with him. My wife did not talk to me the rest of that day. Last elections, my wife and I were active in the Leni campaign. We lost although we could not comprehend until now how and to what extent really. But we accept the will of the people, which is also the will of God. We do not carry rancor in our hearts. As Filipinos, we only have one country and its president happens to be BBM. And so, in honoring both FM Sr. and Ninoy, as well as Cory and Noynoy, we pray to the Lord to remove all pains from our hearts and lead us to move on as one people, one nation."
1,"Compared to nearby Negros Oriental, politics in Cebu is experiencing so much serenity to the level of being boring. Nothing earthshaking is going to happen. Most elections will be uneventful because in many barangays, there are no opponents. In most villages, the results are already foregone conclusions. Whoever the trapos endorse, the people follow. Of course, there are pockets of tremors in some villages but there will be no blood or fireworks on election day. Cebu is strong, sound, and silent under the Dragon Lady from Dumanjug and Barili, Governor Gwen. There is no opposition and if there is one or two, they are never heard or seen. To me, this can be both good and bad. Good because One Cebu means power in united action, synergy, teamsmanship, alliance, and cooperation. But it can be bad too because there is no check and balance. But anyway, this is an LGU and not the Senate or the House. The province needs unity under a decisive, bold, and daring leader who, many events have proven in the past, cannot be bullied by Imperial Manila. Cebu Province comprises one big main island and 167 smaller islands including Mactan, Bantayan, Malapascua, Olango, and Camotes Islands. It has three chartered cities; Cebu, Mandaue, and Lapu-Lapu, and six component cities; Talisay, Carcar, Naga, Bogo, Toledo, and Danao and 44 municipalities. There are seven congressional districts, two districts in Cebu City and one each for Lapu-Lapu and Mandaue. Cebu has 11 representatives in the House. They are so peace-loving that we never heard any of them making waves in Congress like how the late deputy speaker Pablo Garcia used to regale us with amazing speeches and commendable expertise in parliamentary rules and procedures. Cebu is quiet and the congressmen are all silent. Cebu’s 1st District, the biggest in population and the highest in income, is represented by a young lady, Rhea Mae Gullas, first termer and wife of Talisay City Mayor Samsam Gullas. It has a population of 809,335 and comprises the cities of Talisay, Carcar, and Naga and the towns of Sibonga, San Fernando and Minglanilla. The 2nd District, with a population of 257,658 is represented by a multi-millionaire contractor and businessman, also a first-termer, Edsel Galeos from Argao. I call this district ADABOSS for its constituent towns of Argao, Dalaguete, Alcoy, Boljoon, Oslob, Santander and Samboan. The 3rd District is represented by the younger brother of the governor, a multi-termer, Bar topnotcher Pablo John Garcia. It has a population of 616,326 and covers Toledo City and the towns of Aloguinsan, Asturias, Balamban, Barili, Pinamungajan, and Tuburan. The 4th District is represented by Janice Salimbangon, the widow of a former congressman representing the same district. With a population of 540,814, it covers Bogo City and the towns of Bantayan, Daanbantayan, Madridejos, Medellin, San Remigio, Santa Fe, Tabogon, and Tabuelan. The governor's favorite son-in-law, Duke Frasco, husband of the Tourism Secretary Christina, represents the 5th District, which used to be the impregnable Durano Empire. With a population of 643,946, it comprises Danao City and the towns of Borbon, Carmen, Catmon, Compostela, Liloan, Pilar, Poro, San Francisco, Sogod, and Tudela. Daphne Lagon, wife of a party-list congressman, represents the small constituency of the 6th District comprising only the small town of Consolacion and the smaller town of Cordova which are not even contiguous to each other. It has a small population of 218,607 after Mandaue City became an independent city. This is the best example of gerrymandering."
1,"Kon insakto ang akong paghinumdom, ang barangay ug ang SK elections, walay labot sa politika, apolitical matud pa, Apan sa atong naandan, mao ra man og manginlabot gayud ang atong mga politico. Ang mga local officials adunay paluyohan, ug ang mga kandidato mismo, mosangpit og mangayo og tabang gikan sa mga politiko, bisan og endorsement na lang. Mao nga tapus sa eleksiyon, mag-iphanay dayon pipila sa mga kapitan sa barangay ang habig sa incumbent nga mayor ug pipila ang dapig sa opposition. Di ba mao ni ang nahitabo? Sa akong nasayran, the barangay officials do not belong to any political party, kay lagi, apolitical kini sila. Unya, kon madumtanon ang incumbent nga mayor, ang major nga mga mehoras adto punta sa kahabig nga mga kapitan, ug taga-opposition (as if wala silay labot sa local government) maghuwat kanus-a maabuti sa grasya. Apan, sa bag-ong pamahayag ni Mayor Mike Rama, it seems nga nausab na ang senaryo, kay iyang gipahinumdoman ang mag-kandidato sa umaabot nga barangay ug SK elections nga dili nila gamiton ang City Hall pag-promote sa ilang candidacy. Meaning dili nila gamiton ang ngalan sa mayor sa ilang pagpangampanya, kay tingali unya nga moingon sila nga gi-endorse sila sa mayor. “Ang ako karong direksyon, walay pili. Trabaho, trabaho, serbisyo,serbisyo,” nagkanayon si Rama. Maoy iyang gusto nga ang mga kandidato (ma-pro-admin man o ma-opposition) be treated equally. Sa ato pa, walay palabihon, walay pamintaha, patas ang tanan. Ang pag-file sa certificates of candidacy unya pa sa August 28 hangtud September 3 sunod tuig, ug ang campaign period unya pa sa October 19 to 28. Dugay pa, apan namatikdan nga duna nay nag-suroy-suroy nagpunay na’g smile kutob sa ilang matagbuan. Dugay-dugay pa man gayud ang election season maoy hunahuna sa mayor nga dili lang una maghisgot og politika, focus lang una sa trabaho. Pagka-karon, naglaraw ang mayor pagduaw sa tanang 80 ka barangay, ubos sa iyang programa ginganlan og “Simhot Barangay,” diin buot niyang masayran unsa ang mga nag-unang panginahanglan sa barangay, ug unsa ang mga yango-ngo ug sentimento sa mga molupyo sa barangay. Nindot. Niini nga paagi mahiusa ang 80 ka barangay nga gumikan sa politika nagkatibulaag, as if nagpuyo sila sulod sa nagkalainlaing planeta. To prove his sincerity, maayo tingali nga unahon pagduaw sa mayor ang iyang gitohuan nga opposition barangay, sama sa among barangay. Unsa man ni, ipaagi og pulong-pulong? Kon mao, ato lang ning nganlan og Pulong-pulong sa Barangay. Ayaw nang simhot kay medyo dili maayo ang  connotation. Duna man tay mga Baragnay Development Councils, mahimo nga makig-dialogue una ang mayor sa mga sakop niini. Matud sa internet, “At the barangay level, it is the Barangay Development Council (BDC) that shall assist the Sangguniang Barangay in setting the direction of economic and social development and coordinating the development efforts within its territorial jurisdiction.” Unsa may tuyo o objective sa BDC? Ania, “as a collegiate body, a barangay council primarily passes ordinances and resolutions (ila kining i-endorse ngadto sa Sangguniang Barangay) for the effective administration of the barangay. Its powers and functions are defined by the Local Government Code of 1991.”"
1,"Last Wednesday in The FREEMAN, there was this story that, to me, stood out among others. It was about Kathryna Yu Pimentel and her success in various capacities and endeavors. But I would not blame you if you say ""Kathryna who?"" because even with that illustrious last name, it would still take some effort to take in the fact that she is the wife of Senator Koko. Blame the ""Kathryna who?"" on her being a very unassuming, quiet, and low-profile person that even as wife of a former Senate president, such an awkward question cannot be helped from time to time. So why the sudden splash last Wednesday? Because she is the wife of Koko, that's why. No, let me rephrase that. She is the wife of outgoing Senator Koko. At this point let me digress a bit to a few issues back of The FREEMAN when fellow columnist Attorney Josephus Jimenez became probably the first person to start talking about the 2028 presidential elections, still a good five years away. Why, before that happens, there is still the 2025 midterm elections to consider. And then it dawned on me. Kathryna Yu Pimentel making ripples in The FREEMAN, I think, is akin to her dipping a toe in the pool of Philippine politics, where the business of politics is also family business. Of the seven sitting women senators we have, five got their roads to the Senate paved with powerful and popular names that preceded them. So why not Kathryna? Despite her shyness from the limelight, she is actually a very accomplished person. Her lack of public exposure should not in any way serve as a measure of her overall capacity as a person, as a worker and an achiever. In fact, it can be a sterling quality if indeed she makes the jump into politics. She would make one less ""epal"" at least. Her public position, minus the publicity it usually entails, is as chairwoman of the PDP Cares Foundation. While others may scoff at it being a cinch since she is the wife of the PDP party president, I would rather dwell on her being an unsung frontliner who risked her life for others during the most dangerous and difficult years of the COVID-19 pandemic. Kathryna is also a very successful chef and restaurateur, whose Tiong Bahru Philippines is part of the twice Michelin-recognized Singapore parent. To be able to maintain that Michelin quality, knowing how rigid that can be, is to me nothing short of the presidency in her particular field of endeavor. Multiple recognitions is a multiplicity of presidencies. As I mentioned earlier, there are seven sitting women senators in the 19th Congress. Five of them will have their terms end in 2025. That only leaves two through 2028, not a very good reflection of the voice for women in our legislature. Unless of course we vote into office in 2025 a fresh batch of five women senators. Or even more. So, starting with this month as International Women's Month and on to the 2025 midterm elections, the country's 43 million plus voters and counting have ample time to consider their options for new women in the Senate, numbering five to at least replenish the existing number, or even more, to maybe hit an exact one-third of the upper chamber. We have no shortage of women who have made their mark in ventures they pursued. In politics, we have elected two women as president and three as vice president. A 2021 Grant Thornton study shows our country is leading the way in the number of women holding C-level positions with 48% of senior leadership positions being held by them, making us first in the list among all countries in the survey. I think Kathryna should consider a run for the Senate among the many women we need there. And not just because she is the wife of outgoing Koko but because her having been a frontliner as head of PDP Cares during the pandemic shows her willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice for her country and countrymen. The Senate is a small price to repay her."
1,"Layo pa ang October barangay-SK elections, apan, aduna na kunoy mga barangay nga medyo misugod na’g pabukal sa ilang kaldero sa politika. Ambut unsa kini ka tinuod. Apan, diri sa amo, sa Guadalupe, wala pa may kisaw sa politika. Hinuon, tingali’g wa lang ko mahibawo. Dili na man makalansar pag-usab si Kap Mike Gacasan, atong huwaton kinsa ang iyang ituboy nga molansar pagka-Kapitan. Akong gitawgan si Jingjing Faelnar, atong gipangutana kon molansar ba siya, matud niya, gikapoy na siya sa politika. Hinuon, pipila niya ka higala, misugyot nga pagka-konsehal na lang, at least, mapahimuslan gihapon kuno sa  taga-barangay ang iyang serbisyo. No comment ug no commitment yet gikan ni JJ. Anyway, subay sa direktiba ni Mayor Mike Rama, ang bag-ong gitudlo nga officer-in-charge sa Office of Barangay Affairs, si Inting Esmeña, mipahimangno sa mga opisyales sa barangay sa dili una mamolitika, samtang layo’ pa ang campaign period, ug mo-concentrate hinuon sa ilang mga trabaho. Ang filing sa certificate of candidacy (COC) karon pang Hulyo 3 hangtud 7, ug ang campaign period gitakda sa Oktubre 19 hangtud Oktubre 28. So, layo’ pa gyud. Gidili ang pangampanya gikan sa Hulyo 8 hangtud Hulyo 28. Apan, matud pa, galihok na ang kagaw sa politika sa pipila ka barangay. Ang uban kuno nag-finalize na sa ilang line-up. Nilgngiga no, kon tinuod man ni. Pahimangno ni Mayor Mike ngadto sa mga opisyales sa barangay, ilabina sa mga Kapitan: “Focus on job, not on polls.” Atong kutluon kining gikan sa The Freeman, tingalig wa mo makabasa: “Rama had been calling on all barangays, regardless of political color, to do their part to make his vision of a Singapore-like Cebu City happen, as he had been emphasizing, together we can make greater things happen.” Bitaw, sa pagkakaron, ihikling una nato ang politika. Regardless sa kolor sa politika, atong himuon nga damgo natong tanan ang tinguha sa Mayor nga ma-Singapore-like kita. Ug ato kining ma-realized kon mag-usa kita ug magtinabangay, inay nga magpunay pangitag sayop sa uban. * * * Maghisgot na pud ta niining tinguha pagpabanhaw ug paghimo’g mandatory ang ROTC program sa atong nasud. Dili kalikayan nga dunay mga misupak niini, kay dinhi gud sa atong nasud, bisa’g unsay atong buhaton, bisag maayo, duna gayuy mosupak. Main reason sa ilang pagsupak, mao ang ‘hazing’ ug giingon nga mga abuso sa military niadtong pag-implementar niini, hinungdan nga na-suspenso kini. “The reasons why the ROTC program was suspended were because of corruption, abuse and hazing? We need to put a stop to the decadent culture and violent tradition which have long been embedded in the system,” nagkanayon si Sen. Nancy Binay. Apan, sa iyang bahin si Sen. Bato de la Rosa nagkanayon: “The victim died because of fraternity hazing and not of ROTC training.” Ug si Sen. Jinggoy Estrada, namahayag, “In my version of the measure, I have proposed the imposition of the maximum penalty under existing laws against hazing. Hazing is another form of bullying and therefore should never be part of any activity. It has resulted in tragic deaths even until now when we already have a law against it.”"
1,"As far as I know, traditional and neophyte politicians seeking elective government positions are both well-versed in the age-old tactics of giving money to voters to get themselves elected. The wealthy ones with their utter display of arrogance and on the pretext of being imbued with philanthropic heart comfortably give money to whomever they meet in the streets during the campaign period. For they think that by giving money to the people they are assured of victory in the election. Whereas the not-so-moneyed politicians would simply adopt the traditional way of campaigning, elucidating to the public their own platform of governance if ever they will be elected into office. And yes, the giving of money to the electorate is definitely out of question. I think many of us are already aware of the latest news, a shooting incident wherein no less than the governor of Negros Oriental in the person of Roel Degamo, met his untimely demise when a group of armed men (hired killers) barged into his residence, shot him and eight others, killing them on the spot. Since the Ampatuan massacre on November 23, 2009 and the Mamasapano massacre on January 25, 2015, it's really so sad that another massacre of innocent people would happen, and no less than the local chief executive of a province became the latest victim. It is of public knowledge that the late governor never lost in the local elections; however, in the recent political exercise, his opponent emerged the winner. The late governor Roel Degamo then filed a petition for writ of mandamus before the High Court which resulted in the transfer of votes in his favor. It can be recalled the Comelec en banc declared Ruel Degamo a nuisance candidate, and that the votes obtained by him be transferred and credited in favor of Gov. Roel Degamo, giving the latter a number of votes greater than that of his political opponent, Pryde Henry Teves. The Supreme Court in an en banc session affirmed the decision of the Comelec declaring the late governor as the true winner in the gubernatorial race in the province of Negros Oriental. Shooting incidents and poll-related violence has already claimed many lives. Political parties, political groups or political kingpins in a particular place used the power of guns to keep themselves in power, for instance, having private armies to assassinate their political archrivals; for they could hardly accept the fact that their political nemesis emerged victorious in the election, even to the extent of being skeptical about the trustworthiness of the court in handing down its decision on election-related cases. Men in uniform carrying long and high-powered firearms fatally shot the governor and eight others in broad daylight at close range, killing all of them. In a hot pursuit operation carried out by joint police and military teams it was found out that the three arrested gunmen were former soldiers dismissed from service for various offenses. What a shame! Supposedly protectors of the people against lawless elements now becoming killers and criminals? That should not have happened in this country of ours where many of our people are God-fearing and law-abiding citizens. In seeking justice for all the victims of this barbaric, brutal, and merciless slaying of innocent people, masterminds and all their hired killers must be persecuted and prosecuted in accordance with law. ""An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth."" (Leviticus. 24:19–21). An ancient principle during the time of Moses in the Old Testament wherein a man should be punished commensurate to the offense or crime he committed. But not in our times wherein due process of law in dealing with the suspects or criminals has to be applied as appropriate. The 1987 Philippine Constitution says, ""In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved...."" (Article III, Bill of Rights, Section 14, par. 2) With President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. offering to help the victims' families in resolving the case, at least, they can sigh with relief that justice will be served to their departed loved ones, sooner or later.

1,"KAKAIBA ang provincial politics. Malalakas ang loob ng political warlords sa malalayong probinsya. Bakit tinawag na political warlords? Sila ‘yung mga pulitiko na ang dugo ay mandirigma. Matira ang matibay kung sino dapat ang manatili at mamuno. May sarili at kanya-kanya silang mga puwersa’t tauhan. Kakaiba rin ang kanilang mga galawan at estilo sa galawan. Teritoryal ang ugali ng mga political wardlord sa kung sino man ang namumuno. Lalo na sa kung sino man ang gustong umagaw sa pamu­muno gamit ang dahas. Layunin niya/nilang tuldukan ang pananatili mo sa mundong ito. Matinding pinag-aaralan ang galawan ng kanilang katunggali o vice versa. Kapag sila’y na-outsmart, na-outdone, na-outperform, kailangan nang i-outflank ang iyong katunggali. Ang kanilang gamit: guns, gold and goons. Maging ang kanilang mga tagasunod at tagasuporta, kakaiba rin ang isipan at sikolohiya. Matataas ang emos­yon at damdamin. Dahil sa matinding paniniwala at pagsuporta sa “adbo­kasiya” ng kanilang pulitiko, handang gumawa ng bagay kung kinakailangan kahit mauwi pa sa hindi magandang kahihinatnan. Tandaan na sa ganitong mga galawan, mayroon laging utak o ang tinatawag na “the brains”. Kasama rin ang mga tactical planners and recruitment na kung tawagin naman ay “the executioner”. Talagang iba ang kultura kung provincial politics at ang mga political wardlords nito ang pag-uusapan. Nakalulungkot sabihin na ang mga alagad ng batas, mga piskalya, at mga huwes, alam nila kung sino ang mga naghahari-harian at nagsisiga-sigaan. Ang pinakamasaklap, wala silang magawa. Ika nga “self-preservation” na lang lalo na kung ‘yung political warlord ay dikit sa administrasyon. Kaya naman ‘yung desperado, desperado rin kung mag-isip at kumilos. Desperado na rin ang desisyon at aksyon. Huwag naman sanang kumalat ang kulturang ito sa National Capital Region (NCR). Kinakailangan dito na may kinakatakutang batas. ‘Yung batas na hindi ka sasantuhin na pag sinubukan mo, may kalalagyan ka sa lengguwaheng ginagamit mo. Kung itong mga pulitiko dinala sa Maynila, ang mensahe dapat: “pangprobinsya ka lang. Dun ka maghari-harian. Wag mong dadalhin sa Maynila. Di mo teritoryo ‘to.” Ito ang totoong istorya sa mga pinapatay na pulitiko — mga provincial politics."
1,"THE CONVERSATION Wars are world-shaping. Beyond their immediate human and physical tolls, wars alter the fates of societies and states; of clans, cultures and leaders. They establish new lines of access to resources and influence, determining who has what – and who doesn’t. They set precedents for how future wars are justified and, in the case of attempted conquest, wars can ultimately redraw the map of world politics. One year after its unprovoked invasion on February 24, 2022, Russia’s war against Ukraine encompasses all these dangers. With Ukraine waging an existential battle for its very survival, and Russia seemingly happy to settle for destroying Ukraine if it fails to conquer it, neither side has any incentive to stop fighting. Absent the complete collapse of either the Ukrainian or Russian armed forces, the grim reality is that the war will likely drag on throughout 2023 – and potentially beyond it. But what happens in Ukraine during 2023 will be crucial. For a start, it will reveal whether victory for either side is possible, or whether a “frozen” conflict is more likely. It will test the resolve of all the main protagonists and their supporters: Ukraine’s ability to repel Russian onslaughts and recapture territory the extent to which Vladimir Putin can command domestic obedience and even of China’s intentions, as it mulls supplying Moscow with weapons. How the war plays out in 2023 will also reveal how credible the West’s determination to stand up to bullies really is. Will it move further towards supporting Kyiv by all means necessary, revert to drip-feeding its assistance, or give in to apathy and war fatigue? At present, Ukraine continues to have the upper hand, even if Russia’s armed forces have lately wrested back some momentum. But in the coming months, Kyiv will face two key challenges. First it will need to absorb Russian attacks while conducting its own offensive operations, which will require Western heavy armor, longer-range strike capabilities, and possibly air power. Second, Ukraine will require continued international aid and assistance to ensure its social order doesn’t break down as a result of economic collapse, and to be able to mitigate further damage to its critical infrastructure. Conversely, for Russia to turn the tide it will have to dramatically reverse the abysmal performance of its armed forces. The recent spectacular failure of the Russian assault on Vuhledar in Ukraine’s south east, seen by many as the prelude to a Spring offensive, doesn’t bode well. With an estimated 80% of Russia’s entire ground forces now engaged in the conflict, plus tens of thousands of newly mobilized conscripts arriving at the front, there’s mounting pressure on those at the very top of Russia’s military leadership to achieve rapid results. Failing to achieve that will ultimately rebound on Putin. To maintain social order he has become increasingly repressive, banning books, engaging in shadow conscription campaigns, and imprisoning many of those who speak out against the war. And while the bitter infighting between the armed forces and paramilitary organisation the Wagner Group seems to have been settled for the moment, the fact that it was conducted so publicly suggests Putin no longer enjoys the same iron control amongst Russia’s leaders that he once did. Of course, another Russian revolution (either from above or below) is still far off. There’s no alternative value proposition for Russia’s political elites to remove Putin, and the personal risks for trying it remain very high. For its part, Russian society remains effectively apathetic – if no longer very enthusiastic – about the war. Yet that might change. Putin can’t endure unscathed by forever blaming the West, or purging his security services for his own bad choices. His longevity has relied on the bargain he made with Russians: to protect them, and offer them stable lives with gradually improving living standards. In the last 12 months he has broken both parts of that bargain, drafting large numbers of Russians to fight in Ukraine, and causing tough sanctions in response to his actions. By using mobilized Russians as cannon fodder, and having emptied much of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund in 2022 to blunt damage to its economy, Putin has created dual pressures on Russian society. First, the demand for fresh recruits has become recurrent, mandatory and inexhaustible. Second, sanctions are about to bite much harder. And instead of being able to direct mobilization campaigns at Russia’s marginalized and minority groups, affluent and influential areas like Moscow and St Petersburg will for the first time find their livelihoods affected by the war in 2023. If maintaining control at home becomes more challenging for Putin, a new round of brinkmanship will look increasingly attractive. In turn, that elevates the risks of conflict escalation. Already the past 12 months have witnessed the Kremlin flirting with global hunger games, hinting at nuclear annihilation, raising the specter of “dirty bombs”, and branding virtually anyone who opposes Moscow as a Nazi. So far, the West has responded tactfully and proportionately to the Kremlin’s threats. It largely weaned itself off Russian energy over the past year, removing a key part of Russian strategic leverage. But in 2023 we should expect a redoubling of Moscow’s efforts to fracture Western unity. Putin’s propensity for risk means any action short of war in the so-called “grey zone” is possible, as demonstrated by reports the Kremlin has been supporting a coup attempt in Moldova and aiding Serbian nationalists protesting against closer ties with Kosovo. More broadly that list could include blackmail, cyberattacks, sabotage, and even assassinations on NATO territory, coupled to posturing and provocations by Russia’s armed forces. Similar efforts will likely be made to try and sway Western populations. True, Russia’s previous attempts to enlist gullible and/or reflexively suspicious Western citizens with false narratives about NATO enlargement have only enjoyed limited success, mainly because it’s painfully obvious Russia is engaged in a war of imperial expansion. But just like prohibition-era Baptists and bootleggers, it will continue trying to exert pressure by seeking to unite seemingly disparate groups, such as the anti-war campaigns which have brought together the anti-globalist Far Left with the conspiracy theory-laden Far Right. The center of NATO gravity will likely continue to shift further east. Both Poland and Estonia have emerged as strong champions of Ukrainian sovereignty, and have been particularly instrumental in pushing more reticent European nations, including Germany and France, towards a firmer stance. NATO aspirant members Finland and Sweden have been busy too, with both nations increasing their 2022 defense expenditure by between 10% and 20%. With the exception of Hungary, the Bucharest Nine Group – formed in 2015 in response to Russian aggression in Crimea – has emerged as a powerful voice within NATO, advocating for the transfer of more sophisticated weapons systems to Ukraine. In January 2023, Poland announced it was increasing its military spending to 4% of GDP, and it has been placing numerous orders for weapons, including from the US and South Korea. Policy coordination between Warsaw and Washington has increased as well, especially on stationing NATO systems, personnel, and providing training for Ukrainian forces – including US President Joe Biden’s surprise visit to Kyiv on Monday to announce a new military aid package, ahead of a visit to Poland to mark the anniversary of Russia’s invasion. The challenge for NATO is that a two-speed approach to Ukraine within the alliance increases the potential for disagreement and fracture. Conversely, given the reticence of some West European nations to lead the response to Russian aggression, it’s incumbent on the Baltic States, Poland and others to do so. Ultimately, those predicting a swift end to Russia’s war in Ukraine are likely to be as disappointed in 2023, as they were 12 months earlier. The past year has taught us much: about how the weak can resist the powerful; about the dangers of peace at any price; and about the hubris of believing autocrats can be bought off with inducements. But perhaps most importantly it has taught us to question our assumptions about war. Now, one year into a conflict in Europe that many thought impossible, we are likely about to rediscover just how world-shaping wars can be.

Uma­lingawngaw kasi na ikinokonsidera ng administrasyon ni PBBM na kunin ang serbisyo ni Mar Roxas upang tumulong sa pagpapatakbo ng gobyerno. Ano’ng masama roon? Mahigpit na magkakalaban ang mga magulang ni PBBM at Mar sa pulitika, ganundin ang pamilya ni Ninoy Aquino, pero kahit ganu’n ay hindi naman naulinigan ng mamamayan na nagpersonalan ang mga anak nito maliban sa panahon ng eleksiyon. Pulitika lang ‘yan mga tsong! Malapit na kamag-anak ni First Lady Atty. Liza Araneta Marcos si Mar Roxas kaya bumubula ang mga bibig ng mga kritikong Marcos loyalists sa galit. Baka naman hindi alam ng karamihan na ang nanay ni Mar ay isang Araneta at maging ang asawa ng kapatid ni PBBM na si Irene ay dugong Araneta rin. Mayayaman ang pamilyang Araneta at walang nabalitang nagnakaw ang mga ito sa gobyerno.

1,"CEBU, Philippines — Cebu Fifth District Representative and Deputy Speaker Vincent Franco “Duke” Frasco is gaining the support of all town officials in the district except Danao City. This after the mayors and vice mayors of the four towns in Camotes Island have left the Barug Alang sa Kauswagan ug Demokrasya (BAKUD) and forged an alliance with the incumbent congressman. BAKUD is a political party in the fifth district led by the Duranos. San Francisco Mayor Al Arquillano and Vice Mayor Aly Arquillano, Tudela Mayor Jojo Solante and Vice Mayor Erwin Yu, Poro Mayor Gary Rama and Vice Mayor Dina Rama, and Pilar Mayor Winky Santiago and Vice Mayor Chiziline Maratas signified their allegiance to Frasco’s camp on November 21. These officials took their oath of allegiance before Frasco. Witnessing the oathtaking were Department of Tourism Secretary Christina Frasco and Liloan Mayor Aljew Frasco. Previously, these officials also took their oath with One Cebu before Governor Gwen Garcia. Mayor Arquillano said they informed the officials of BAKUD about their transfer of allegiance. “Actually para ni sa atong constituents. Mao na ang hinungdan,” Arquillano said, in a phone interview with the Capitol reporters. BAKUD chairman emeritus, Danao City Vice Mayor Ramon “Nito” Durano III said the recent development is “unfortunate” but acknowledged this is the “political reality.” “We understand the circumstances and we do not harbor ill-feelings towards defecting party-members, partners, and friends,” Durano said, in a statement. Durano said the officials from Camotes Island reached out to them and informed them of their plans. Despite losing allies, he said the local political party of BAKUD “will continue to work with people of the Fifth District of Cebu.” It can be recalled when the congressman first ran for Congress in 2019, only two of the mayors of the 11 local government units in the district were allied with Team Frasco, namely Liloan and Borbon. “After having instituted our programs and projects focusing on education, health, and infrastructure that dealt sweeping change across the District, by 2022, six mayors and their local slates won and/or were reelected with Team Frasco,” said Frasco, in a statement. The deputy speaker expressed his thanks to the people of the district for their continued support. He also expressed his gratitude to party members across the district who have been with him since the start and positively responded to the unification of Camotes Island. “I am grateful as well to the newest members of Team Frasco who now join us in our cause to bring hope and change to the District after 70 years,” Frasco said. The congressman said that this unity will usher in the continued transformation of Camotes Islands to become a tourism gem of Cebu. — Le Phyllis F. Antojado, GMR (FREEMAN)"
1,"MANILA, Philippines — Lusot na sa House Committee on Suffrage and Electoral Reforms ang panukalang magpaparusa sa mga balimbing sa pulitika sa bansa. Ang House Bill (HB) 488 o ang House Strengthening the Political Party System ay inihain ni House Senior Deputy Speaker Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Isinulong ni Rep. Arroyo ang panukala dahil maraming mga pulitiko ang bumabalimbing o lumilipat ng partido. Alinsunod sa nasabing panukala, awtomatikong maaalis sa ‘elective office’ ang isang opisyal kung lilipat ang mga ito ng partido isang taon matapos o bago ang eleksiyon. Hindi rin ang mga ito maaring tumakbo sa anumang posisyon sa isasagawang pinakamalapit na halalan bukod pa sa pagbabawalan ding matalaga sa anumang posisyon sa gobyerno sa loob ng 3 taon. Ipagpapabawal din ang paghawak ng mga ito ng posisyon sa lilipatang partido at kailangan nitong ibalik ang lahat ng ginastos o ibinigay sa kanya ng iniwanang partido kasama ang 25% surcharge. Binigyang diin ni Arroyo na nilalayon ng panukala na palakasin ang sistema ng partido pulitika sa bansa at mahinto na ang pagbalimbing ng partido ng mga opisyal. Aminado ang lady solon na normal na sa mga pulitiko na magpalipat-lipat ng partido para lumaki ang tiyansang magwagi sa eleksyon. Ayon pa kay Arroyo, dahil sa pag-anib ng ilan sa mga partido pulitikal ay para lamang ito sa kanilang kaginhawaan at hindi dahil sa ‘ideological commitment‘."

1,"For a huge compensation of P1 a year, one city in the Visayas retains my services as senior HR and political adviser. Consultants merely give non-binding advice. They are not responsible nor accountable to the people. I accepted the challenge for the love of country and for my respect and concern for the mayor. I give my advice freely on hiring, transferring, reshuffling, promoting, disciplining, dismissing, as well as rewarding deserving personnel. But only if I am being asked because he has a well-paid HR director and a highly-competent city administrator. I understand, he is not renewing hundreds of job orders and consultants. That's good. But I have nothing to do about it. Many of these people are non-performing political underlings. I'm sure there will be a lot of backlash. But the mayor is firm and he is ready to face the consequences. Most of the time he has other influencers who whisper a thousand suggestions, some with vested interests. He has even engaged the services of a former Senate president, who was also a former DOLE secretary but I am the only one with 28 years of experience in HR in San Miguel, Pepsi, and Petron. Yet, I have no control over him except moral suasion as his former Law professor. Mine is a remote voice in distant Metro Manila. But whenever he asks me, I tell him straight and I call a spade a spade. I tell him to play politics in all other things but when it comes to leading people and managing their performance, he should be 80% professional and only 20% political. As HR adviser, I give professional inputs into his decision making but I am not responsible for the consequences of his decisions because he has hundreds of other advisers and consultants. Too many culinary consultants tend to confuse the cooks and the chief cook ends up making decisions largely based on his own discretion. Be that as it may, I am sharing the travails of a mayor who wants to do good and to make his city excel, but is surrounded by many conflicting pressures emanating from various political allies. The problem with the government is that many of its personnel are political appointees, with problems on competence and professionalism. This mayor is a former HR manager himself of an Aboitiz-owned company based in Cebu. He is also a brilliant HR professional although, as a politician, he needs a professional like me to give him a second opinion. But he is also hardheaded and when he decides, no one can ever stop him. His city faces a lot of problems internally. There are many competent people in the city government who are assigned the wrong jobs, meaning square pegs in round holes. Every councilor has a number of ""bata bata"" among the personnel, and when the mayor tries to discipline them, the councilors intervene. That is where the mayor should draw the line. Where does politics end and good governance begin? What the mayor needs is a professional HR who should be shielded from political pressures. He should assign one who is not only competent and honest but is brave and relentless, one who is prepared to lose his or her job any time. No matter how brilliant the HR director is, if his excellent plans are blocked by the city council by withholding funds or obstructed by jealous department heads by intrigues and schemes, then HR in the city government is bound to fail. City Hall is like a little Malacañang or a mini White House. There are lots of petty wars on turfs and endless rumor-mongering and backstabbing. People are too focused on defending their asses and have no time to think about public service. If the mayor does not clean up his cordon sanitaire and his sanctum sanctorum, his own underlings, subalterns, and trusted field commanders are either going to sabotage his marvelous vision and grandiose strategic plans, by sheer ineptitude, plain incompetence or reckless actions. Worse, in another scenario, they themselves stage a coup d'etat to topple him and replace him with another whom these people can easily control and manipulate. If I am going to deserve my P1 a year, I should tell the mayor to take a draconian measure of defending himself against his own people. That is if he is willing to listen."
1,"We should not kid ourselves and believe in that hackneyed political line that mayors and governors, like presidents and vice presidents, are servants of the people. Tell that to the marines. We were not born yesterday. First and foremost, let us face the truth that they are all political animals by the realities of transactional and traditional politics. Most of them are trapos anyway. Politicians, by the very essence of Philippine politics, make decisions in order to protect, preserve, and defend their own selfish political agenda. They make choices that shall favor their own business interests and also make sure that their cronies, underlings and subalterns, their ""anaks"", ""inaanaks"", and ""kamag-anaks"" are appointed to strategic agencies so that they could control funding, infrastructures and decision-making. They make sure that roads are built where their own properties are located. And if, by chance, their decisions also promote public interests, that would be a huge bonus to the people. But that is not the principal purpose of traditional politics. But mayors and governors should remind themselves that even their own political survival and advancement might be put in jeopardy once they make wrong decisions or take options that are palpably dishonest, wrong, seriously immoral, unethical, or unpopular. That is why they need a professional, honest, competent, and hardworking city or provincial administrator who can be delegated to do what should be done even if unpopular. Mayors and governors should surround themselves with professionals and technical experts, technocrats who have the guts to say their piece, call a spade a spade and tell the hard truth. They should shun mere political jesters and blind followers who do not add value to decision-making. I am currently advising two mayors and one governor in Luzon, two mayors and one governor in the Visayas, and one governor and two mayors in Mindanao who were all my former Law students and who believe in my principles, rely on the wisdom of my advice, and trust my experience in decision-making. They pay a huge fee each, ?1 a year, but I have the right to tell them straight when they are wrong, scold them if I need to, and I can leave them without prior notice. I meet each one of them every week on a digital platform and also face-to-face once every quarter. They provide me a business- class plane ticket and a hotel suite and I fly to where they are or they fly to where I am most conveniently located. They all follow my JBJ pentagon test in executive decision-making, based on what I learned from Wharton. In making choices and decisions, whenever subordinates present a proposed project, a decision to be made, an appointment to be conferred, or funding to be given, they need to be convinced of the correct answers to five questions. First, can the proposed project really be done and implemented? Second, is the proposal affordable and cost-effective based on a cost-benefit analysis? Third, is the proposal legal, ethical, and conforms to the core values of the province and the city? Fourth, what benefits will the city or the province derive out of it? Fifth, will this project enjoy popular support by the people? The first is the test of technical feasibility. The second is financial soundness. The third is legal and ethical propriety. The fourth is the test of beneficiality. And the fifth is the test of political wisdom. If mayors and governors want to do an excellent job, they should listen to the sound advice coming from experienced and competent professionals whose integrity is beyond reproach, and who have no hidden agenda."
1,"The upcoming US midterm elections on November 8 reminds us of Filipinos who have been deeply involved in American politics. I can immediately recall Ben Cayetano, whose parents were both Filipinos but was born in Hawaii. He rose from the lowest political rank to be elected governor of Hawaii and held that office from 1986 to 1994. October has been declared as Filipino-American History Month. There are hundreds of Filipinos who are in US public offices, either elected or appointed. Next to the Chinese, the Filipinos represent the second biggest group of Asian immigrants in America. There were about 4.5 million Filipinos in America as of 2017. They are estimated to be about five million as of today. The big bulk of them are in California numbering 1,651,933 in 2017. The next biggest is Hawaii with 367,364; Texas, 194,427; Washington, 178,300; Nevada, 169,462; Illinois, 159,385; New York, 144,436; Florida, 143,481; New Jersey, 129,514; Virginia, 198,128; Maryland, 71,858; and Arizona 70,333. There is no space here for those with less numbers. Would you believe that the first Filipinos in the USA arrived in California in the 16th century but the first recorded Pinoy was Antonio Miranda Rodriguez in 1781? Stockton, a farming community, was the place where the largest group of Filipinos outside the Philippines was concentrated. Today, the biggest community of Pinoys is in Greater Los Angeles, followed by the San Francisco Bay Area, San Diego County. I used to enjoy my annual vacations in an amazing lake city, South Lake Tahoe straddling between northeastern California and Nevada. It was the place where one of “The Godfather” movies was shot. Many famous movie and sports activities have vacation homes there. There are many Pinoys working in the casinos in the Nevada side while residing in the California side of the lake. In politics, the Filipinos are the biggest racial group in Honolulu and nearby cities like Pearl City. Ben Cayetano was born in Honolulu and grew up in Kalihi, studied in Farrington High School, and later in Harbor College and in the University of California in LA. He completed Lis law studies in the Loyola Law School at the Loyola Marymount University. When he came home to Hawaii, he was appointed by the governor of Hawaii as head of the Hawaii Housing Authority in 1972. Then, he entered politics and was elected state representative in the Hawaii state legislature, representing Pearl City. He joined Governor John D. Waihee in 1986 and became the first Filipino to be elected lieutenant governor. They were reelected in 1990. In the elections of 1994, Cayetano ran for governor and was elected. The Filipinos, for the first time, were united to vote for a Filipino governor. In 1998, Cayetano was reelected in the most contested election. He defeated the Republican candidate, Linda Lingle, mayor of Maui by a very slim plurality. After his last term, the law disallowed him from running again, He retired undefeated and engaged in business. Cayetano represents the best of the Filipinos in the US. There are many in California, Texas, Illinois, New Jersey, and other states where Filipinos serve in some minor elective offices and others appointed to high state and federal posts. I used to live with my parents in Hawaii and then they transferred to Fife City, near Federal Way, south of Seattle in the state of Washington. Six of my siblings live and work there now, and I visit them every year. They are also active members in the Filipino communities there. And work is more important to them than politics. I am the one who is more inclined to talk and write about American politics and I always update them with my research findings and analysis. Filipinos are considered important factors in the US economy and also in politics."

1,"Ubiquitous and iconic, Istanbul's street dogs have been swept up in a political storm involving President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and an app that helped get them killed. The sheer number of stray animals dogs and cats both-- darting between people and lounging on public squares jumps out at most visitors to Turkey's ancient cultural capital. They could well be descendants of the dogs glorified in the first grainy photos of the city, in which they roam in packs near landmarks such as the Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque. This is no accident, according to Ekrem Isin, a researcher who wrote ""The Four-Legged Municipality: The Street Dogs of Istanbul"". ""We are a society that coexists with animals. Actually it's an eastern tradition. Every neighborhood has its dogs and people who take care of them,"" he said in an interview. In some Islamic cultures, the faithful see dogs as innocent creatures that will speak on judgment day and open the believers' way to heaven. But until then, they are viewed as unclean and best kept out on the streets. ""So although our people loved dogs, they did not take them home but fed them on the street,"" Isin said. It has been a love-hate affair of late that, like most things in the painfully polarized country, has taken on a political life of its own. Erdogan casts blame Late last year, a four-year-old girl was attacked and seriously injured by a pair of pit bulls in Gaziantep, a large city in the southeast. The pit bulls were pets rather than strays but Erdogan seized on the incident, declaring: ""Stray animals belong in shelters, not the streets."" The seemingly innocuous comment was in fact a jibe aimed at his great rival, Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. Politically ambitious and media savvy, Imamoglu beat Erdogan's ally in highly controversial polls in 2019, handing the city the Turkish leader himself once headed to the secular opposition CHP party. Two months before the girl's mauling, Imamoglu had launched one of his many social media campaigns --this one featuring the travels of a stray called Boji on Istanbul's trains and ferries. Erdogan's message was clear --the government was trying to make the streets safe of dogs let loose by the opposition. CHP's deputy leader Ali Oztunc, who oversees animal welfare, accused the government of failing to give opposition-led cities enough funding to neuter and shelter strays. ""It acts as if (cities) should take care of their own business,"" Oztunc told AFP. Heart-rending wails The arguments grew more urgent with the emergence of an app called Havrita --made up of the words ""woof"" and ""map"" in Turkish-- which allowed users to report the exact location of strays. Dogs began dying in droves after Havrita's launch in May. ""We began to hear more about poisoning cases or mass killings,"" said lawyer Gulsaniye Ekmekci of the Istanbul Bar's Animal Rights Commission. This month, an Ankara court sided with Havrita's critics, blocking access to both its website and the app. ""We cannot solve the problem by killing animals,"" Ekmekci said. Istanbul has tried eliminating its dogs before. In 1910, the Ottomans exiled 80,000 strays to a deserted island in the Sea of Marmara as part of a modernization drive aimed at giving the empire's then-capital a more European feel. ""There wasn't a drop of water to drink and the dogs killed each other out of hunger and thirst,"" wrote French novelist and navy officer Pierre Loti, who frequented Istanbul at the time. ""Whenever a boat passed near the island, all of them would run to the shore and you could hear heart-rending wails."" Fulya Ozerkan Burcin Gercek Agence France-Presse"
1,"Politicians, including the president, would love to impress the people with the wisdom of reducing excessive fats in the Philippine bureaucracy. But since they are politicians, all those who use the mantra of rightsizing end up bloating the government even more. Think of two million in the national government, another two million in the local government units. These include casuals, contractuals and Job Order workers. How will the president reduce all these and to what extent? If we need to be serious about these, the national government can reduce its manpower force from two million to only 1.5 million. The provinces and cities can retire, retrench or declare redundancies by 30 percent or from 1.2 million to only 800,000. That means eliminating the sources of livelihood of no less than almost a million government personnel. The big question is: Do politicians have the balls to do it? I don't think so. Most of them are thinking of the next elections. Of course, the majority are career and professional employees. But most of the rest of government personnel are close proteges, ward leaders and political followers of the appointing powers. That is why rightsizing is a big buzzword that sounds impressive to the press but a big headache to public officials. The government is the biggest employer in this country. Its rightsizing can exacerbate the unemployment and underemployment demographics in the country today. As of May 2022, the unemployment rate was six percent, worse than April which was 5.7 percent. The poverty line is 23.7 percent or about 25 million Filipinos living below the National Poverty Line. This number includes many lowly government officials. Will the government cut the only sources of livelihood for these people? I do not believe so. What rightsizing model will the government use? Will it reorganize, restructure, merge agencies and consolidate many redundant government organizations? Will it abolish useless offices? Will it reduce non-performing top officials? Or will it hit only the small guys who have no political connections nor clouts? For instance how many undersecretaries and assistant secretaries are there. During my time, there was only one DOLE undersecretary in the 1970s under Secretary Blas Ople. Why are there five or six usecs and even 10 asecs in some other agencies? If there should be a reduction of personnel, it should start at the top. There is too much specialization and divisions of turf among undersecretaries and assistant secretaries. All usecs and asecs should be generalists and should be competent and willing to handle any part of the agency's functions. There are many operating units that can be merged or consolidated. There should be an extensive review of functions and a purpose-driven process of restructuring. There should be a moratorium in the creation of new agencies. Times are hard and this is not the proper time to enlarge the already bloated bureaucracy. There should also be a moratorium on hiring. Consultants should be minimized to the barest minimum and hiring JOs should be stopped. These people are exploited to do dirty, difficult, dangerous and degrading jobs while the regular personnel are just wasting time and resources of the government. Professional HR practitioners should be hired to clean up the manning of all agencies. The Civil Service Commission should perform its task as the official HR of the Philippine government. Above all, we need heads of offices and agency top guns who are decisive, highly-principled and truly committed to rightsize the Philippine bureaucracy. If the president is truly committed to this, his SONA speech on rightsizing should be, by this time, already translated into a task force with a specific goal, and a timetable executing his decision. If not, then that reference to rightsizing would just be another mantra like the jetski braggadocio of his immediate predecessor. The people are sick and tired of big words signifying nothing. With all the powers of the presidency, rightsizing can be done. It won't be easy but it is not impossible. The president just has to find one guy with the competence, commitment and balls to prepare the blueprint and the same should be enacted into law for execution next year. No ifs, no buts. Just do it."
1,"We live in an era where etymologists and grammarians are collaborating to come up with new words or phrases that are politically appropriate. So that, as we now often hear, the physically disabled is now called differently abled. Those who are mentally retarded are now referred to as mentally-challenged. Those who are not blessed with height are now called vertically challenged. There are phrases too that have been coined because some words were perceived to have negative connotations. For instance, the phrase “thoughts showering” is now widely used instead of the word “brainstorming.” They go for it because storming or forcing the brain to come out with great ideas does not do anything good at all while “thoughts showering” encourages one’s mind to think and come up with great ideas freely. On the other hand, it also in this era where techies and innovators are also coming up with jargons of their own. Words and phrases that look and sound negative but have positive connotations. For instance, several decades ago, we adopted the phrase “burn the CD”, which means to write a content to a CD. We are also embracing the word “disruption” as good when added to the word “business” in referring to “any innovation within an industry that radically and lastingly changes the way all companies in that industry operate.” Recently, industry moguls and mainstream media have coined another phrase using also a word that has negative connotation to the word “travel.” The word “revenge” is added to the word “travel” to come up with a very popular phrase nowadays, “revenge travel.” While some grammarians, media personalities and travel operators disagree with the phrase, it is enormously getting positive responses. To them, the thought that we must take revenge against a debilitating virus in modern times cannot be ignored. True enough, literally, there a lot of reasons why we must take revenge against COVID 19. To recall, until the end of 2019, world tourism was flourishing. It continued to rise despite wars, political chaos and threats of extremisms, among others. In fact, even countries with so much sophistications in terms of threat-readiness and were on their toes 24/7 were not spared of those threats too. Yet, their tourism initiatives thrived. It did rise constantly even if the paranoia that no one was safe obtained. A survey published by the World Economic Forum (The Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report 2019) confirmed this.  According to the report, “in 2018, the industry helped generate 10.4% of world GDP and a similar share of employment, and has shown enormous resilience over the last decade.”  It further reported that “fueling this expansion and relative resilience was the continuing growth of the middle-class in Asia and other parts of the world.” On account of this growth, the industry boldly predicted that “in the coming decade, industry contribution to GDP is expected to rise by nearly 50%.” Considering the trajectory then, such prediction was so appropriate. However, as the citizens of the world were held hostage by the virus, such projected increase were never seen or felt. In fact, not only that it did not increase, the global tourism industry, as a whole, was almost brought down to ground zero. Today, the citizens of the world are up in arms and are travelling again. With the thought of taking a revenge against COVID 19, despite high plane ticket prices (due to the oil price surge), demands are surging. For instance, Allianz Partners (a travel insurance company) “analyzed more than 40,000 trip itineraries planned for this summer and concluded that American travel to Europe will jump 600% from last year.” And this is not limited to Europe. In an industry conference last month, Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said that “demand is off the charts.” The fact is, according to the report, the “airline industry is struggling to keep up.” We can feel this so called “revenge travel” in the country too. I am one of those who already made trips domestically and am a living witness to this development. Also, conventions and conferences are back even in Cebu. As a testament, the certified public accountants in Cebu and neighboring provinces had a very successful summit at Radisson last Thursday and Friday with more than 500 in attendance. As a testament that domestic travels are starting to go back to pre-pandemic level, our resource speakers (who are mostly from Metro Manila that included renowned economist Bernardo Villegas), expressed their optimism as their respective flights were all fully booked. Indeed, it is time for revenge."
1,"Here in Mexico, while drinking strong coffee and smoking Cuban cigars after meeting local politicians, businessmen, and lawyers, we are discussing the Senate. The Philippine Senate, which used to be the chamber where future presidents were trained, and where the booming voices of Claro M. Recto, Lorenzo Tañada, and Jose W. Diokno rang with unquestionable eloquence and erudition, is now the house of senators Robin Padilla, Jinggoy Estrada, Bong Revilla, Lito Lapid, and Raffy Tulfo. Well, Recto or not, we need to respect them, call them honorable, pay them huge salaries and allowances because they were elected by Filipinos who believe the nation's deliverance should be entrusted to comedians, action stars, and TV hosts. The Filipinos rejected Gibo Teodoro, a brilliant Bar topnotcher and Dick Gordon, a parliamentarian par excellence, and even denied a former vice president. The new Senate has four reelected senators, Win Gatchalian, Juan Miguel Zubiri (incoming Senate president), Joel Villanueva, and Risa Hontiveros. They will be joined by five former senators: Loren Legarda, who just completed her term as representative of the lone district of Antique; Francis Escudero, who ended his term as Sorsogon governor with an auspicious grand salute by the Bulusan eruption; Alan Peter Cayetano, who ended his term as representative of Taguig, Pateros, and as former speaker of the House, whose term claimed as one of its grand achievements the historic denial of franchise renewal of ABS-CBN. And of course the two half-brothers from San Juan, JV and Jinggoy, one of whom is the good one. The Senate where great Cebuano senators like Don Vicente and Filemon Sotto, Don Manuel Briones, Don Mariano Jesus Cuenco, and Chief Justice Marcelo B. Fernan is now the office of mother and son senators Cynthia and Mark, siblings senators Alan and Pia, and half-brothers, JV and Jinggoy. This is democracy, and in this country, a Bar topnotcher like Gibo Teodoro (who topped in 1989 with the Golden Dean's Medal for Academic Excellence from UP) is rejected in favor of actors and comedians. This is the nation where a brilliant lawyer, Dick Gordon, a crusader against graft, is rejected by the sovereign people in favor of jesters and action stars, courtesy of the election results computed by counting machines. The four reelected and the five comebacking solons will be joined by three eager beaver neophytes who outvoted the veterans. They are led by 2022 senatorial election topnotcher, Robin Padilla, incoming chairman of Constitutional Amendments, entrusted by Senate president Migz Zubiri the monumental mission to tinker with the fundamental law of the land. God bless the Philippines. Then, Raffy Tulfo, now the greatest of the five famous Tulfo brothers whose other brother is a partylist representative, and the other is DSWD secretary. Their sister, Wanda was, of course, the wonder girl of tourism under President Duterte and we know the rest of the story. Raffy will come back to the Senate where the Tulfos were summoned as resource persons by the senate Blue Ribbon in connection with Wanda's wonders in tourism. And of course, the silent one, Mark, who claims credit for “Build, build, build”, the so-called hardworking son of an incumbent senator and a father who could have been a better president than PNoy. These two brave women, Loren and Risa plus the ten lucky men will join incumbent senators Cynthia Villar, ex-future Senate president; Juan Edgardo Angara, son of former Senate president Ed Angara; Nancy Binay, who could have been joined by his dad, former vice president Jejomar; Pia, happy with younger bro, Alan joining her again; Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa, a senator courtesy of President Duterte, ditto with Christopher “Bong” Go; Lito Lapid, the Leon Guerrero from Porac, Pampanga; Imee Marcos, sister of you-know-who; Koko Pimentel, Bar topnotcher, former Senate president and looming minority leader; Bong Revilla, who can dance and sing well; Francis Tolentino, who also won with the presidential blessings in 2019. Well, this is democracy. The Senate is now purely a family affair, an ABS-CBN telenovela, starring Gerald Anderson and Sam Milby, brothers in the drama. If this drama does well, Gerald and Sam may join Cardo Dalisay and Piolo Pascual as our next candidates for senators in 2025. A family affair, indeed, where mom Cynthia is sitting with the silent son Mark, where the good one JV sits behind his Kuya Jinggoy, and siblings Pia and Alan Peter are representing the tiny constituency of Taguig. Wow. This is a funny country. With a coming food shortage and oil crisis, with the peso diving to unprecedented depths, and oil rising to unchartered heights, we have elected entertainers to amend our Constitution and solve the social cancers of this great nation. Iba talaga ang Pinoy, mahirap espilingin."
1,"The Myanmar junta's plans to execute political opponents may amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity, a UN official said Monday. The junta said on June 3 it would execute a former lawmaker from Aung San Suu Kyi's party and a prominent democracy activist, both convicted of terrorism, in what would be the country's first judicial executions since 1990. Four people, including former MP Phyo Zeya Thaw and democracy activist Ko Jimmy, ""who were sentenced to death will be hanged according to prison procedures"", junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun told AFP then. Nicholas Koumjian, head of the UN's Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar, said he was following this case closely. ""The available information strongly suggests that under international law, fundamental rights of the convicted persons were blatantly violated in these proceedings,"" Koumjian said of the trials, which were closed to the public. ""Imposing a death sentence, or even a period of detention, on the basis of proceedings that do not satisfy the basic requirements of a fair trial may constitute one or more crimes against humanity or war crimes,"" he added. The junta has sentenced dozens of anti-coup activists to death as part of its crackdown on dissent after seizing power last year, but Myanmar has not carried out an execution for decades. For a trial to be considered fair it must be held in public to the greatest extent possible, said Koumjian. ""Exceptions based on national security or other considerations must be limited to the extent that they are strictly justified,"" he said. But in these cases, ""it appears that there were no public proceedings nor are the judgments publicly available"". This raised doubts as to whether the tribunal was impartial and independent, he added. The UN mechanism for Myanmar was created by the UN human rights council in 2018. Its task is to gather evidence of international crimes and human rights violations in the former Burma and document them with a view to facilitating criminal proceedings. Agence France-Presse"
1,"All human endeavors, especially those involving and affecting a significant number of people, requires feedback mechanisms to evaluate the effects/progress/success of the actions. These are needed to be able to correct, alter, and improve the actions/directions for even better results. This is true in biological, physical, and technical systems, like the effects of medical treatments and medicines, or when we use a new computer software and we run a “beta” version. In social and political systems, the feedback mechanism is more complex and complicated due to their structure and restrictions depending on the government and ideology. In the current information technology-dominated socio-political milieu, these are the objects/subjects of data analytics, the internet of things, and all the algorithms that mine the responses, reactions, and feedback from consumers, respondents, and citizens.  This is even more important in the bigger society, as it affects the lives and livelihood of more people, and spells the successes and failures of businesses and governments. In the political sphere, it would be a fatal mistake for a political strategist/tactician to misread political reactions and repercussions of voters and the general population, because they failed to hear the voice of the opposition. To stifle or suppress the opposition may mean the absence of the more substantive and meaningful feedbacks, while relying on the always positive and adoring praises of the vested interested allies and cronies. To get a balanced perspective, governments have to hear all criticisms, from moderate to the extreme and filter them accordingly. There are an abundance of historical examples of this truism. The beginning of the end of the Roman Empire started when the emperors became more powerful due to their conquests, that it diminished the importance and power of the Senate. The drift to authoritarianism and the decreased involvement of the people led to the civil wars that eventually ended the Roman Empire. The same is true of the Incan Empire that fell to the Spanish conquistadors because the king decide on his own that the invaders were white gods. The same can be said of the French monarchy who were oblivious to the complaints of the excesses of the royalty. More recent historical examples would be the Marcos and Suharto dictatorships which eventually led to their downfall. Also, the economic decline of Myanmar and Venezuela, where the dictatorships have driven out all local and foreign investors, thereby stagnating and downsliding their economies.  Turkey, Russia, and China are also showing slower economic growth as their governments crack down on private initiatives and enterprises and the governments becoming less receptive to public dissent. Dictators and authoritarian governments have a natural aversion to opposition and criticism, especially the longer they are in power. As society gets bigger and multiple competing interests grow, this aversion is the seed of its own destruction. Truth and justice are the basic ingredients of a peaceful society and progressive economy, which a political opposition can be relied to provide. Truth and justice are not partisan concepts but unbiased values without regard to ideology. To gain the trust, confidence, and support of the people, governments have to be truthful and dispense justice fairly to all. To do more business, the buyer or seller has to assume that both are telling the truth and that they are getting a fair deal. The incoming Philippine government administration has not really defined what their “unity” propaganda means. It means unity of purpose and aspirations for the people, this will not be a problem. But if it means unity to accept what they do, right or wrong, it will be a big problem. A necessary political opposition will be the big help for the government to succeed or even survive. It is also the responsibility of the political opposition to be active and survive if we are united for the country to prosper economically and politically."
1,"The bitter defeats suffered by moneyed and well-organized candidates last May 9 polls should teach both the traditional and emerging new politicians a big lesson. The debacle suffered by former vice president Jojo Binay, former presidential candidate Gibo Teodoro, former senators Dick Gordon and many other local bets should leave the politicians some very useful lessons. Why were the powerful Espino brothers defeated in Pangasinan, the well-entrenched Sy-Alvarados in Bulacan, Art Yap and Rene Relampagos of Bohol, the Degamos in Negros Orietal? Even the seemingly invincible Danilo Suarez of Quezon was beaten by a lady doctor, Dr. Helen Tan, by a staggering upset of more than 700,000 votes over only a little more than 300,000 for the incumbent Suarez. Oca Orbos, a former national figure, a cabinet member and vice presidential candidate, could not even win an election for congressman in Pangasinan. Oca Moreno, incumbent city mayor of Cagayan de Oro, a former Ayala executive, lost his gubernatorial bid in Misamis Oriental. In Cebu, a very well-funded campaign for the Argao mayorship by the incumbent congressman of the second district, Willy Caminero, failed to win over incumbent mayor Alan Sesaldo. I predicted a landslide win by Caminero. But his equivocation and his secretive and unclear stand on whom he supported for president did him much disadvantage and he ended supporting Marcos but losing his bid. His brother Dr. Stanley, who was also defeated by Sesaldo, won as number one board member representing the district. Dr. Stanley was for Leni and he was very open, clear and emphatic on it. The victory of Edsel Galeos over Tata Salvador was expected. And Congressman Willy will find it harder to beat Galeos in 2025. The defeat of the Sitoys in Cordova is another episode of well-entrenched political families who lost their patriarch, the well-loved, my good friend, the late Adelino Sitoy. The younger Sitoys do not have the magic touch, the warm charisma of the old man. And they were not united. Too many Sitoys running ended with all them losing the mayorship and the congressional seat. The same is true with the Radazas. They have stayed too long in Lapulapu and they did not perform as much as Ahong Chan in such a short time. The Radazas were abandoned by their leaders including many barangay captains and ward leaders. Well, that is how the cookie crumbles. I have written extensively on the defeat of the Duranos in the fifth district but the last debacle suffered by Ace Durano in the hands of governor Gwen was too devastating. Ace did not win in any town, and clinched a win only in Danao among all the component cities. Ace Durano even lost tremendously in the fifth district while his vice governor, Junjun Davide, who is from the south, did much better than Ace in the north. This is the territory which used to be the Durano empire for more than fifty years.In Carcar, Patrick Barcenas with 43,177 votes, defeated Nice Apura who got only 28,291 for mayor. Efren Quijano with 36,240 votes won over Mercy Apura with 32,733. The Carcar voters are tired of the Apuras who governed Carcar for too long as a conjugal monopoly. In Malabuyoc, an independent mayoral candidate, Edang Piedad defeated Daya Creus overwhelmingly and an independent vice mayoral bet, Ann Allosada defeated the long time mayor Lito Creus also comfortably. The Creuses were One Cebu official candidates. This only means that when the people are already exasperated with trapos, no one is indispensable, even those aligned with Gov. Gwen and Marcos. Even the Osmeñas, the Duranos are gone. Wala talagang forever."
1,"Wouldn’t we all like to see that the new political decision-makers, who just won in the elections, put our shared interests ahead of their own? Business and government are encouraged to scrutinize their cozy relationship and see to it that politics and regulations are made in favor of the common good and not in favor of narrow personal interests. Consequently, both the private sector and the new government should call for coordinated action against the usual efforts that are undermining integrity. Let’s also get the message across that building political integrity requires more than fighting corruption. Government and private institutions need to make immediate and concerted efforts to ensure that the lives of ordinary people are not affected by corruption, being aware that corruption aggravates inequality: the well-off can afford bribes, but the poor often do without basic services. Government and private institutions should: 1. Build people’s trust and participation by ensuring that decision-making is fully transparent, enabling citizens to hold governments to account. 2. Protect all who expose corruption, including through the protection of whistle-blowers. 3. Build integrity standards in the private sector by strengthening corporate anti-corruption standards. 4. Reduce opportunities for corruption in government contracting by improving the availability and quality of public procurement data and inviting civil-society organizations to observe the contracting processes. Let’s expand the Integrity Circles that we have established with quite several LGUs across the country; the representatives of the Integrity Circles are regular participants in the public procurement processes. 5. Ensure accountability for abuses of power, including breaches of the rule of law, through effective monitoring, enforcement, and dissuasive sanctions. Let’s clearly understand that the future of the country and our societies hang in the balance of integrity, ethics and equality. It is up to citizens like you and me to create change. We have to make our voices heard by those in power – both in government and in the private sector. If you too would like the common good to prevail, let’s create the Integrity Nation, a nation where transparency and integrity rule and where corruption in no longer part of everybody’s life. The time for change is now. Let’s work together in the Integrity Initiative and in Integrity Circles. Feedback is more than appreciated – contact me at [email protected]"
1,"The Osmeñas are a vanishing political clan. Sonny and Lito are both dead. Serge is out of politics. Tom is silent after Margot's loss to Mike Rama. There are no anointed successors. The Duranos had been vanquished by Governor Gwen and Congressman Duke Frasco. Tony Cuenco also left, together with Raul del Mar and Benhur Salimbangon. My old ninong, Eddie Gullas, has retired from politics happily with grandsons taking over. The Radazas were torpedoed by the Chans in Lapu-lapu City. The Ouanos seem to limit their fiefdom in Mandaue. Only the Garcias and the Ramas remain standing and ready to do battle. Cebu is now looking at the Garcias as the new political titans. There are no more Sottos, Rodriguezes, Osmeñas, Cuencos, or even Duranos. The Garcias are now the strongest political family in Cebu. Malacañang has to reckon with the Garcias if the president wants things to happen in this part of the country. If we shall have a future senator or Cabinet member, it will most probably be from the Garcia Family. Winston can be a good secretary of finance or trade, and Governor Gwen can be the next senator, once mayor Christina Frasco or her husband, Duke, is ready to take over the Capitol. Raymond is a future mayor or congressman, and many other younger Garcias are waiting in the wings. You may not know this, but the Garcias are the only politicians with two towns of origin; Barili and Dumanjug. The joke was that their house is right on the boundary of the seventh and the third districts; the sala is in the 7th District and the bedroom in the 3rd District. That is why any Garcia can run in either or both districts. There was a time when the late Marlon was the mayor of Barili and the late Nelson was the mayor of Dumanjug. Manang Gwen was governor and Pablo John is the unquestioned political kingpin in the 3rd District. Winston was head of the GSIS. There was a time the late Noy Pabling (that is our term of endearment for he was a distant cousin of my late father from the Paras side in Dumanjug and Barili) was the congressman representing the undivided 2nd District comprising 15 towns from Argao to Dumanjug. But he was defeated by a young farmer from Argao, Willy Caminero, who is term limited, and tried to go back as mayor of Argao. But he was defeated by incumbent Allan Sesaldo who was supported by One Cebu of the Garcias. In the 1930s prior to World War II, there were two brilliant young boys and students from Bitoon, Dumanjug, who emerged as the brightest stars in the south. The elder was Jesus and the younger was Pablo. They had to walk from Bitoon to the poblacion every school day to study in the town's only complete elementary school by then. Today, both Noy Jesus and Noy Pabling are no longer with us. But Noy Jesus left SunStar as his legacy, and his sons which include former Transportation secretary, Jesus B. Garcia, Jr., former mayor Alvin, and grandson Raymond, the newly-elected vice mayor. Noy Pabling has more successors including Governor Gwen, deputy speaker PJ, and Christina, the trusted spokeswoman of the new vice president. The Garcias are brilliant lawyers, most of whom were Bar topnotchers, like Noy Jesus, Noy Pabling, and Pablo John. Noy Jesus was a delegate to the constitutional convention of 1973, together with retired chief justice Hilario G. Davide, Jr., the father of the vice governor. Noy Pabling, to me, was the best trial lawyer. I saw him in legal combat. He could make the most hardened criminal confess in open court by his cross-examination skills. I look forward to seeing the Garcias rise even higher in the Philippine political arena. They are the best and the brightest. No other clan now can hold a candle before the Garcias today. I am going to drink to that wish and I do hope for the best for the Garcias."
1,"What unites a nation and divides it decades later? Is it culture, nationality, religion, territory, or political ideology? Historically for centuries, the survival of the people depends on their ability to group and fight, adapt to the environment against diverse events, natural or human-made. There is so much to tell about Russia and Ukraine presently at war after the dissolution of the USSR. Ukraine comes from the old Slavic term for the borderland. Ukraine is the second-largest European country by area in the East, after Russia. It shares borders with Belarus to the north; Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary to west Romania, and Moldova to the south. Its capital city is Kyiv, with a population of 43 million. With the proclamation of its independence in August 1991 and adoption of the 1996 Constitution, it became a presidential republic under a mixed semi-parliamentary semi-presidential system with separate legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Ukraine is a developing country with a low-middle-income economy. It is one of the world’s largest grain exporters but remains a poor and corrupt country in Europe. Following its independence, Ukraine declared itself a neutral state. It formed a limited partnership with Russia, other countries, and NATO in 1994. In 2013, after the government of Victor Yanukovych had decided to suspend the Ukraine-European Union Association Agreement and seek closer economic ties with Russia. Several months later, the demonstration began, which later escalated into the Revolution of Dignity that led to the overthrow of Yanukovych and the establishment of a new government. These events prompted the annexation of Crimea by Russia in March 2014 and the war in Donbas, a protracted conflict with Russian-backed separatists. The Donetsk Peoples Republic and Luhansk Peoples Republic are disputed territories in Donbas. These two republics are pro-Russian but regarded by Ukraine as terrorist control. Both countries declared independence from Ukraine, then in February this year, the two republics were recognized as independent states by the Russian Federation. When these two states in conflict with Ukraine asked for military and financial aid from Russia, the situation in those regions became increasingly worse and more critical. Russia disliked the pro-Western government of Ukraine under President Volodymyr Zelensky a comedian turned politician. His move towards the European Union and defensive military alliance with NATO threat to Russia’s national security and interest. Russia wants NATO to remove its forces and military infrastructure from member states that joined the alliance in 1997 and not deploy strike weapons near its borders. NATO expanded beyond the reunification of East and West Germany in 1990. NATOs expansion in Europe dramatically has included 14 former Soviet Union States: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Slovenia, Croatia, Montenegro, Albania, North Macedonia, and Bulgaria. For President Vladimir Putin, the joining of Ukraine to NATO will be a monumental loss to the last historical state of Russia. Ukraine is politically divided over the issue of total independence from Russia. That was evident during the Donbas war. The conflict between these two is akin to the Biblical David-Goliath fight. Russia is one of the World superpowers, while Ukraine is only one of its states a century ago. The United States of America funded Ukraine with military aid and strategic planning along with its NATO allies is helpless against Russian invasion. The current economic sanction against Kremlin expects to neutralize Russian aggression. Russia warns NATO and Western Allies that their involvement in the Ukraine crisis is a dangerous move. How unfortunate that political ideology divides a great nation. And such division may cause unspeakable World War III, God forbid!"
1,"It was a campaign like no other in recent memory. But it’s over now. It’s time to move on. It is only natural --but not advisable-- that during any political campaign unprintable words are uttered. I have some words for the winners as well as the losers: Let us not take things personally. I witnessed the passion and enthusiasm of the supporters of Leni Robredo and Bongbong Marcos. I believe that in any group, the diehards do not comprise the majority. Many are moderates who just want to go on with their daily lives, unhampered by toxicity, win or lose. The best way for us to understand each other is to know that we may be confronted with the same facts, but we always differ in our conclusions. People will either look away or look our way. We should celebrate the fact that democracy is still alive and kicking. In some parts of the world, we can never campaign without risking our lives the way we campaign in the Philippines every election. We can shout until we are blue in the face or until kingdom come. So, instead of hating each other, why don’t we try appreciating each other? Let me try. I appreciate the fact that Leni’s campaign was characterized by sheer volunteerism. People from all walks of life pooled their resources in an effort to overcome the vast machinery of the opponent. You could see young faces leading the house-to-house campaign to face both the enjoyable and the painful experiences. On the other hand, I saw how ordinary Filipinos who supported Marcos endured the name calling. I also saw how BBM and Inday Sara opted not to answer controversial issues and instead continue their own way of running their campaign. We still have so many things to work on in improving this work in progress called democracy. I believe that both camps employed trolls. They might be mandated from their campaign managers or initiatives of their loyal supporters. They encouraged fake news whenever it suited their interest. “All warfare,” according to Sun Tzu, “is based on deception.” Let be quick to point, however, that such “deception” is not always in the negative sense, such as when he advised that when you are strong, pretend that you are weak. To every winner: Know that on your shoulder is a huge responsibility that comes with the position that you aspired for and won, so huge that it will break men and women made of weaker stuff. There are times you have to make unpopular decisions, and alone in your own room, you will have to wrestle with your conscience. Only a good moral compass can truly help you. To every non-winner: You either look at defeat as a fresh start or the end of the road. Many stories have been told about many people who bounced back after experiencing defeat. They picked up the broken pieces and learned from every painful lesson. To all of us: The truth is that moving on is everyone’s responsibility. Victory will be empty if we remain unforgiving and if are harboring grudge towards our fellowmen. Victory will be empty if draw pleasure from ridiculing the defeated. But just as heavy is the responsibility of the defeated to concede defeat. Defeat can be meaningful if we understand that there are better days ahead."
1,"The COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine invasion are still hogging the news in the main and social media that there is little coverage of the happenings in Sri Lanka. But with the Philippine elections in a week’s time, there are abject lessons we should learn with the causes and effects of the current dismal situation of Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka, a developing country of 22 million people wracked by demonstrations that have already killed and injured some of the citizens, is technically economically bankrupt as they are unable to import fuel, medicines, and basic necessities not produced in the country. The country has defaulted on its loan obligations, and their currency has been devalued even if there are already restrictions in the importation of goods including medicines. There are daily 13-hour brownouts and the prices of medicines have risen by 40%. The finance minister is pleading with the World Bank, IMF, and China for bailout loans to stave off larger demonstrations or a revolution which could be triggered if social conditions further deteriorates. Some socio-political analysts have contended that the current government dominated by the Rajapaksa Family bankrupted Sri Lanka in 30 months. The reality is that this family has dominated and mismanaged the country for decades, and the people now want all of the family members to leave the government. There are currently five Rajapaksa family members in the Sri Lanka government. Mahinda Rajapaksa is prime minister, younger brother Gotabaya is president, Basil is finance minister, Chamal is transport and agriculture minister, and Namal is minister for sports and youth. The eldest is Mahinda at 79 years old, and the youngest is Namal who is 35 and is groomed to be president. Mismanagement of the economy with the attendant corruption led to huge budget deficits. Then, they moved closer to China to secure $7 billion worth of loans for infrastructures that were overpriced and did not generate the revenues. These were compounded by the pandemic that dried up tourism revenues and investments that by the end of 2021 the government was fiscally bankrupt. Since the government positions have been rotated among the family members for years, the people are now blaming the family for all the problems and want them all out of the government. The old issue of Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s human rights violations/war crimes for 40,000 deaths during the civil war with the Tamils, has been resurrected as the local investigation was never completed after the family refused an international investigation. The next few weeks will determine the fate of Sri Lanka. It could become a failed state and amble along for years like Venezuela, but it does not have the oil resources of Venezuela which is propping up the government, so it will be in a worse situation. The Rajapaksa Family is exploring the formation of a coalition government, with some of the family members taken out to be able to convince the creditors of a new responsible government. The depth and complexity of their problem needs an overhaul of taxation and other revenue capabilities of the government, and disciplining the expenditure side which may take years. The Sri Lankans are in for more years of suffering. The similarity/mirroring of Sri Lanka’s development and situation happened and is happening in many developing countries, including the Philippines with family dynasties in their governments, and especially with populists leaders who promises largesse to their followers. As in the Philippine experience, the bigger the family dynasty in the region, the less economically developed the region is. The family dynasty treats their political fiefdom as a family corporation to promote their financial interests, crowding out all other investors and businesses in the area. We really should not vote for family dynasties in the coming May 9 election."
1,"CEBU, Philippines — Cebu City mayoralty candidate Margot Osmeña of Bando Osmena Pundok Kauswagan (BOPK) has assured that Ramon Alcoseba is not a stranger in politics and is a very capable substitute to his father, the late councilor Raul “Yayoy” Alcoseba. The multi-titled basketball coach who served Cebu City as councilor for 12 years died last week while seeking for reelection. With his untimely death, the law provides that the party in the case of BOPK can only substitute Alcoseba with someone bearing the same family name as the National and Local Elections is already on May 9 and ballots are already printed Alcoseaba’s name. “It’s his son (Ramon). His son will be replacing him (councilor Alcoseba),” said Osmeña. Osmeña also said that they are already preparing the certificate of candidacy of Ramon together with the certificate of nomination and acceptance (CONA) at the Commission on Elections office. Osmeña said Ramon has long been with his father and has also been representing his father in the campaign sorties since the start of the local election campaign period that Cebuanos are also familiar with him already. “Si Ramon, iyang anak, sige nag kuyog niya (Yayoy), so he’s not a stranger to what they are doing or to what his father was doing,” Osmeña added. Osmeña even shared that it has been their joke to Ramon that he is the “yayo” of Yayoy. “Dugay na..dugay na nga siyay sigeg kuyog namo..dili kanang bag-o pa..He (Ramon) has always been there all the time with his dad,” said Osmeña. Amidst what happened to the late Alcoseba, Osmeña said, they are moving on forward, working double time on the campaign since elections are already very close. “Syempre naningkamot gyud mi coz we are already in the final stretch naman ni noh..So, whatever we had to do, we will do…and what is right..always in the confines of what is right..and you know, I take seriously on what we signed covenant..Sometimes I get weary on signing those things because you know, are we just signing this for you? For the camera…but I take that seriously…It’s too late in my age to change who I am,” said Osmeña. If elected, Osmeña said, the first thing that she would do is to clean City Hall. “To clean the house..to clean the house..You know, take stock, unsay wala diha. Determine what is needed as compared to what you want, very simple para nako,” said Osmeña. Osmeña, who is known to have a heart for the children, is also expected to give priority to Operation Second Chance, saying she is so worried about it and the facility needs trained personnel for them to get a chance in life. “Kinahanglan gyud diha nga personnel, trained, kay lahi gyud..Dili man ni mga bata nga buotan, badlungon gyud..That’s why they are there..they are caught and sent there. So let’s give them a chance and give ourselves a chance kay walay gyud bata nga magsulti nga inig dako nako, puhon mapriso ko,” said Osmeña. Osmeña also said they will also look into helping Pasil which gained some attention lately following a viral photo during the inauguration of the Cebu-Cordova Link Expressway. However, Osmeña clarified that they will look into it, not for aesthetic purposes, but to help them have better lives. “It should not be the CCLEX as the reason kay bati. Sa picture, bati sa postcard..but because we want to help them sama sa among pagtabang dili lang sa Pasil but sama sa among pagtabang sa uban,” said Osmeña. — GMR (FREEMAN)"

1,"The whole nation of 112 million people are going to be lorded over by 24 lucky Filipinos, who represent the ultimate illustrations of political dynasties. If Jojo Binay wins, he will sit with Nancy Binay. If Mark makes it, his Senate babysitter is his mom, Cynthia Villar. If Alan Cayetano wins again, he will be seated next to Ate Pia Cayetano. Then the two sons of Erap, the good one and the ""not so good"" one, will be together again. This will make our country a distorted democracy by monopoly of power. Are you proud of it? Well, this is nothing new. There was a time when Dra. Loi Estrada was in the Senate with Jinggoy. There was also a time when both Pia and Alan were in the Senate, and the two half-brothers too. I do not know if BBM and Imeldific were in the Senate simultaneously. Of course, earlier in our history, we had Don Filemon Sotto and Don Vicente Sotto but the older one was in the Senate from 1916 to 1922. The younger was elected in the 1940’s and 1950’s already. Was there a time when Sonny and Serge, cousins, were in the same Senate together? Yes, I think so. The Osmeñas were also parts of a dynasty. Actually, we have had a lot of precedents. Ed Angara, from 1987 to 2013 and his son, Sonny, from 2013 up to present. Gaudencio Antonino, from 1961 to 1967 and his wife Magnolia, from 1967 to 1972. There were six Aquinos coming from the same family; Benigno Sr. from 1925 to 1934, Benigno Jr. or Ninoy from 1967 to 1972, Agapito “Butz” from 1987 to 1995, Benigno III (PNoy) from 2007 to 2010, Bam from 2013 to 2019, Tessie Aquino Oreta from 1998 to 2004. Kris almost made it as the seventh, if not for her health issues. There were also the Cayetanos; Renato Companero, the father, from 1998 to 2003, Pia from 2004 to 2016 and 2019 to present, Alan from 2007 to 2017. It's all in the family. Taguig has become their virtual empire, with wife, Lani and brother Lino. Ramon Diokno was senator from 1946 to 1949 and his famous son, Jose, was senator from 1963 to 1972. If we elect Chel, Jose's son, that will be three generations of the great Dioknos. Erap was senator from 1987 to 1992, Dra. Loi from 2001 to 2007, Jinggoy from 2004 to 2016, and JV from 2013 to 2010. They were not related to Eva Estrada Kalaw, senator from 1965 to 1972. There were three generations of Guingonas; Teofisto Sr., from 1920 to 1923, Teofisto Jr. from 1987 to 1993 and from 1998 to 2001, and Teofisto III or TJ from 2010 to 2016 (what happened to TJ, by the way)? The Laurels too; Jose Sr., from 1951 to 1957 and from 1967 to 1972, Salvador “Doy” from 1967 to 1972, Sotero from 1987 to 1992. The Magsaysays; Genaro, the uncle, from 1959 to 1972, and Ramon Magsaysay Jr., the nephew, from 1995 to 2007. The Marcoses: Ferdinand Sr., from 1959 to 1965, BBM from 2010 to 2016, Imee from 2016 to the present. The Osmeñas: Don Sergio from 1922 to 1935; Serging from 1965 to 1972; Sonny from 1971 to 1972, from 1987 to 1995, and from 1998 to 2004. Serge, from 1995 to 2007 and from 2010 to 2016. Nene Pimentel was senator from 1987 to 1992 and from 1998 to 2010. Koko Pimentel was senator in 2011 up to the present. Also three generations of Roxases; Don Manuel, from 1941 to 1946; Gerry from 1963 to 1972, and Mar from 2004 to 2010. The Sottos; Don Filemon from 1916 to 1922, Don Vicente from 1946 to 1950, Tito Sen from 1992 to 2004, and from 2010 to 2022. The Tañadas; Lorenzo, from 1947 to 1971 (four terms), and Wigberto from 1987 to 1995 (two terms). Tecla Ziga, the first female to top the Bar exams, was senator from 1963 to 1969. Victor was senator from 1987 to 1992. Ramon Revilla Sr. was senator from 1992 to 2004. Bong was elected from 2004 to 2016, and from 2019 to present. Claro M. Recto was senator from 1931 to 1935, 1941 to 1946, and 1952 to 1960. Ralph Recto, the grandson, from 2001 to 2007 and from 2010 to 2022. I don't mind the good ones but how about the jokers, the jesters, and those who could only dance the budots? My God, is this the country of people worth dying for? Ninoy must be squirming in his grave."

1,"What happened last Easter Sunday revealed the true colors of political opportunism, and gave the people glimpses as to who among Isko, Ping, Gonzales, and Pacman was Dimas, Estas, Barrabas, and Judas. That Maritess presscon in Makati boomeranged on their faces and made them lose votes, instead of advancing their political campaign agenda. On Gaudete Sunday, God allowed such a blunder to materialize and expose the gross political incompetence, total lack of principles, and unexpectedly, the absence of basic foresight and even of the most fundamental common sense among these pretenders, who dream to become president over 112 million people. Good for them. The die-hard Leni supporters were giggling to their hearts' content while the BBM trolls, who might have written the script, must have been biting their lips. Those clueless opportunists went to the hotel, without a clear plan and made fools of themselves. After a day or two, they ended up blaming each other for that monumental fiasco. Well, I read somewhere that those whom God wishes to destroy, he first transforms into madmen. The greatest victim of that comedy of errors was Isko. It showed to the Filipinos that Isko is not really the smart guy that he projects himself to be. He could be manipulated by his secret idol, BBM. And he fell into the trap of the media reporters, who asked him some tricky questions. He is not really the street-smart kid from Tondo, that fictional image that he always tries to create, as the storyline for his own glorification. That presscon in Makati was a very revealing, if devastating fiasco. To me, it was the best evidence that Isko is really an opportunist, a trapo who does not make things happen, but the guy who drops the ball at a crucial point of the championship game, the kid who breaks the glass and makes a fool of himself. Well, the true Isko, at least, has been exposed. The true Isko is actually a Judas-like Machiavelli, who betrayed Mayor Fred Lim, the former senator and mayor of Manila, who picked him up from Tondo, and made him a councilor. Isko also betrayed Erap, who made him vice mayor over many more qualified, decent, and dignified leaders, because both of them are from showbiz, and they created a love team that misled the Manila voters, not once but many times. Isko is like Brutus, who conspired with other Roman traditional politicians, and together with Cassius, stabbed their trusting friend, Julius Caesar, during the Ides of March. Isko will do anything and everything to advance his own selfish agenda. He has no loyalty to anybody. He is only loyal to the true Francisco Domagoso, period. I hope that deputy speaker PJ Garcia, Isko's most prominent endorser in Cebu, will realize before May 9 that he is supporting an unprincipled traditional politician. If I know Noy Pabling well, and if the old man were alive today, he would smell Isko out like a rat. You just have to google Isko's name and Wikipedia will tell you that every election, Isko rides on a different party. He does not care about ideology, virtues, or principles. He has no clear vision and mission, no definite set of values and tenets. He takes whatever is convenient, whatever is easy and he has no track record of true principled decisions and actions. He is a plain and blatant opportunist. Pacman is more honest than Isko. Ping is more competent than Isko. Norberto Gonzales should have known better than sit beside Isko in the betrayal table of conspiracy. Isko is the most deceiving character actor who creates an image of purity and deludes himself that he can fool the people all the time. If he can do that in Tondo, he cannot do it in Cebu and in the rest of the country. Those who saw the blunders last Easter Sunday should realize by now that we should know better. There are predators in the animal kingdom, like chameleons, a mimic octopus, and a crab spider that change colors whenever they want to devour prey. We should be wary of such deceivers. People of the Philippines, be careful with Isko."

1,"CEBU, Philippines —  Senatorial candidate Francis “Chiz” Escudero said the next administration should support the agriculture sector and strengthen efforts in revitalizing the economy amid the COVID-19 pandemic and following Typhoon Odette. Meanwhile, another senatorial aspirant, movie star Robin Padilla, urged voters, including Cebuanos, to not to be consumed by too much politics. Escudero, current governor of Sorsogon, said that while infrastructure programs must be sustained, the agriculture sector must also be given more attention. He cited that under national budget for 2022, the Department of Public Works and Highways was allocated P840 billion while the Department of Agriculture, only P80 billion. “Agriculture country ba tayo o bansa ba tayo ng kontrakto? Ang pinakamahihirap na Pilipino ay nasa sektor ng agrikultura. Ituloy natin ang Build Build Build pero sana, huwag natin gawing kapalit nu’n ang maliit na pundo sa sektor ng agrikultura. Dahil ang pinakamahirap na Pilipino, nasa sektor na yan. Mangingisda, magsasaka, magtatanim na gulay, magniniyog, dapat magbigay ng suporta ang gobyerno,” Escudero said in a press conference in Cebu. As tourism continues to be one of the sectors hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic, Escudero also emphasized the role of storytelling in fortifying tourism. “Tourism is about the story that you tell. It’s not about the beautiful beach, the beautiful scenery, the whole edifice,” he said. As an example, he cited Da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, noting that millions of people visit Paris just to see the masterpiece in person. “We have our own stories to tell. I hope our tourism officials will realize that,” the husband of popular vlogger, influencer and movie actress Heart Evangelista said. Escudero also shared his plans to pass an Odette Rehabilitation Bill to uplift the local governments to recover from natural calamities. He also vowed to submit legislation in rehabilitating MSMEs (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises), citing that more than 90 percent of the country’s economic source is this sector. The comebacking senator is also encouraging voters to learn how to let the heat of the election pass. “You should look at the person you are talking to as that person, not the color he or she brought in the last election. Walang maling boto sa halalan, dahil isa lamang ang sinusunod sa halalan, ang gusto ng nakararami. Kung  ano man yun, karapatan ng bawat botante magpasya at sabihin yun,” Escudero said. Meanwhile, Padilla, who was on a recent campaign trail in Cebu, urged voters, especially the Cebuanos, to not be consumed by politics. “Eto pong darating na eleksyon, huwag tayong maging masyadong kainin ng pulitika dahil sobra-sobra na po ang pulitika sa Pilipinas kaya, eto po, hanggang ngayon hindi tayo nakakausad. Ang pakiusap ko sa inyo namnamin natin ang essence ng continuity dahil napakahalaga po niyan,” said Padilla. Padilla also urged voters to vote for candidates who believe in Charter Change. “Kailangan na po natin palitan ang Saligang Batas dahil yan mismo ang nagpapahirap sa atin. Dapat ang isulong natin federalismo para ang mga Bisaya, taga-Cebu at sumikat din. Hindi pwede na ang laging sikat taga-Maynila lang,” Padilla added. — JMD (FREEMAN)"
1,"Somebody has said this, “Politics is a long game. It’s a marathon, not a sprint.” And I agree. This has always been the fault of our political system --parties are formed, alliances are built for convenience. They are mainly done for the sake of winning elections and keeping power. Winning elections is important. But if electoral victories are made from political marriage of convenience, backroom deals, and money changing hands, the result is an exceptionally weak political system unable to withstand foreign influence and geopolitical pressures. This has been the case in the Philippines since its independence after the war. Those with a modicum of principle are outwitted and outgunned by political butterflies and chameleons. Our history is replete with prominent examples. Pedro Paterno played in both camps during the revolution against Spain, conveniently switching sides depending on the prevailing political winds. He was that character portrayed in the 2015 film ‘Heneral Luna’ who argued in the Aguinaldo Cabinet for an alliance with the Americans, thus effectively stalling General Antonio Luna’s strategy of pre-emptively striking Intramuros while the bulk of the American forces were yet to land in Manila, and likewise the strategy of building fortifications in the mountainous north. Ferdinand Marcos switched from the Liberal Party to the Nacionalista Party in the 1965 presidential election. Those were the times we effectively had a two-party system. Marcos’ reason was that his erstwhile party mate and then president Diosdado Macapagal supposedly reneged on his promise not to seek a second term. There are plenty more examples that I could not mention due to lack of space. The point is our politics in the Philippines has largely been built around the self-interest of people recognized as leaders by their respective communities and by society at large. There are a few exceptions but they are too few to make an impact. Leftists argue that one of the roots of our problem is foreign domination. I say no --the cause of our problem is that most of our leaders take advantage of the fact that many of our voters fall for wit and cunning. Add to that our corrupted sense of entitlement and a lack of sense of what is just and fair, it then becomes a perfect recipe for foreign manipulation and domination. That’s the reason why I am inspired by the movement built around the presidential candidacy of Vice President Leni Robredo. It’s not a flawless coalition but many Filipinos are looking to Robredo’s track record and integrity as a source of hope for long game politics. A politics that this built of grassroots work painstakingly and consistently done over a long period. The forces of former senator Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. and Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte are counting their eggs because they are already sure of winning the May 9 presidential election. “Daog na! Daog na!” was the shout during their rally at a three-hectare property in SRP this week that drew a large crowd made way larger by police and partisan guesstimates. Thursday night I was with my wife (an avid Kakampink) at the campaign rally of Robredo and her running mate, Senator Kiko Pangilinan. People gathered at the five-hectare venue in Mandaue City (with many more spilling into streets and center island) were also shouting “Daog na! Daog na!” I like Robredo’s reaction when she said to this effect, “Sure ba kayo? May labing anim na araw pang natitira sa kampanya. Kailangan pa nating magpursige.” No politician of consequence in Cebu, except for Vice Governor Hilario Davide III and former Cebu City mayor Tomas Osmeña, is openly endorsing Robredo’s candidacy. So she has been asking the people directly to make her win again in Cebu. If Robredo wins this May 9 election, it might not put an end to the politics of convenience that has dominated our country for a long time, but I believe it can be the start of a movement toward a mature political system. One that is built based on our core belief as Filipinos and on what I said earlier -- grassroots work painstakingly and consistently done over a long period. Hopefully those gathered at the Kakampink rally last Thursday take time to learn the lessons of EDSA 1986. Thirty six years ago we did put an end to a kleptocratic dictatorship, but we just went on with our lives and simply left the post-EDSA governance and its hero Cory Aquino at the mercy of political opportunists and chameleons."
1,"CEBU, Philippines —  With a lot of interpretations on how far the priests can actively be involved in politics, Cebu Archbishop Jose Palma leaves it to priests’ prudent judgment Palma said there are some bishops who say that as long as priests are not using the pulpits, it is okay. “The idea is the pulpit should be a place where you should be more specifically a place for you to preach about faith and religious matters…but outside that, the priest is simply a Filipino in this matter,” said Palma. Priests also have the right to vote and be involved. “They said, this is our right…and that is the line of thought for some priests. It’s a borderline active involvement in politics,” added Palma. With some priests having such a line of thinking, Palma said, “I leave it to their prudent judgment”. As the 2022 National and Local Elections are getting closer, the archbishop is inviting everyone including the priests to utilize the occasion of the 28th anniversary of the creation of the Archdiocese of Cebu as a day of prayer and discernment. “I would invite everybody to make the 28th anniversary of the creation of the Archdiocese a more serious day of prayer and discernment for the coming elections,” stressed Archbishop Palma. Along with this, Palmas also strongly encourages groups to make public their discernment and their choice, regardless of their particular groups. “Election of leaders is most important, sacred, and relevant for the revival and redevelopment of our country,” said Palma while saying, he is not endorsing anyone nor is favoring one party or politician. — Decemay P.

1,"Why do many people quarrel a lot about the crowd estimates in political rallies? The answer is that a political rally is a show of force. It can create an impression that a political team’s victory is inevitable. It also targets the undecided, particularly those whose decision is based on going with the flow. Humans have the tendency to side the majority, real or perceived. The history of the world may have been characterized by few brave men and women who chose not to side with the majority. But during elections every vote counts, whether it is cast by a genius or someone clueless. That is the reality of politics, and that is democracy. There is so much subjectivity during electoral campaigns. I am sure, however, that there is also an objective way of estimating the size of a crowd in rallies. We know that a particular area can accommodate only a certain number of people. Any claim, whether it comes from the camp of Leni or from the camp of BBM, can be verified. Police Lt. Col. Wilbert Parilla of Cebu City Police Office estimated that 300,000 people attended the recently-held Uniteam’s rally at SRP. As reported, he also said that the venue has an area of three hectares only. Critics were quick to point out that such estimate may be too big, given the area. They pointed out that every hectare is equivalent to 10,000 square meters. So multiply it by three hectares. That equals to 30,000 hectares. Then multiply it by four as every square meter can only accommodate four persons. Therefore, if people are jam-packed in that area, then the crowd should only be 120,000. I expect that the Kakampinks’ rally, held in Mandaue, will receive similar scrutiny, particularly the size of the rally area as the point of reference. As of this writing, the rally has not yet formally started. What is funny is that if the crowd estimate coming from the police and the organizers appeals to or is in consonance with our own group’s self-created reality, we clap our hands. People, indeed, see not what is there but what they want to see. Our obsession with crowd size will see reality on May 9, 2022, election day. Ug dinhi makita ang katag. I would venture to say that once upon a time, before the age of the internet, big crowd sizes during rallies brought chills down the spines of political opponents. But the rule of the game has changed to some extent. Now, many get their information and form their decision on what they have gathered themselves, and not on what they heard from the stage. Crowd size during rallies may give us an idea, no matter how little, on the strength of the group. The reality, however, is that people attend rallies for a thousand and one reasons. Not a few attend because they want to see their favorite singers, actors, and actresses. They want to get entertained. They attend all rallies, regardless of which team organizes them. Political parties know that if they don’t hire entertainers or clowns, many people will not attend. Well, dili pud hinuon tanan."
1,"As the election approaches, politicians' support is solidifying and intensifying as they hope for some conversions and final decisions from the undecided. But, no matter how difficult the last several weeks have been, a presidential candidate cannot gain a majority vote in the country's plurality or ""first-past-the-post"" system. In this ""winner takes all"" system, the candidate with the most votes wins, while others are left with nothing. When multiple candidates compete for a single position, however, ""vote splitting"" is unavoidable. As a result of the rule of minority, a politician who has a strong voter support can win. The final rallies may determine the eventual outcome. As a result, rallies have become a competition among politicians and their parties to see who has the largest turnout. Only the thousands of participants would be boasted about, an exaggeration that would be at odds with a more reasonable estimate based on the projected number of people per square meter. It has become a convenient approach to produce figures that are reinforced by the camera's careful angling to appear as though there are a large number of participants. Indeed, in order to attain this number, parties would use a variety of gimmicks to entice a large number of people to attend, even if many of them have their own agenda or reasons for going. Some people, for example, might go to rallies for entertainment. Celebrities as guests are likely to attract a large crowd to the rallies. While waiting for the other participants, they even provide some preliminary entertainment. So much singing and dancing, as well as comedic acts, to break up the monotony. And what was intended to be the highlight, the introduction of governance platforms, would be pushed to the background or even ignored. We constantly maintain that quality is preferable to quantity. Others also believe that quantity equals popularity, as evidenced by polls. According to polls, the two most popular presidential contenders are those whose rallies are well-attended. As a result, those at the bottom of the surveys would settle for group meetings, press conferences, and television appearances because large audiences are difficult to come by. Elections are, and always have been, popularity contests. No matter how hard we try to persuade people based on valid criteria such as integrity, honesty, commitment, and platform clarity, some will still vote for the candidate who is most popular among the candidates, even if it means justifying the idea that voting for a candidate who is not a sure winner is a pointless exercise. However, each vote conveys the values, ideals, and aspirations of the voter for the candidate who will carry them out. This is the person whose sole purpose is to make it happen. However, it appears that some of us no longer believe in such idealistic thinking, as nothing has ever materialized after the election. It's as if hoping and believing for nothing. We can't say we blame them. Rather, it is up to us to provide whatever inspiration we have left and to keep hoping for the best. Finally, attending rallies demonstrates support for a certain candidate. But, once and for all, the quality of discussion, track record, and sincerity of purpose are more important factors in determining who we vote for. Because some people aren't accustomed to working in an environment where excellence is demanded, please let us serve as a barometer of quality."
1,"If the Cebuanos cannot take Kiko to accompany Leni, they will most likely go for Tito. The Osmeñas have the best combination: Leni-Tito. The Sottos have given Cebu so much honor, so much support and so much inspiration. The Dutertes abandoned Cebu, left for Leyte and then proceeded to Davao, prospered and became famous there, and never looked back to Cebu. They just come to us again to ask for political support. But what have the Dutertes done to Cebu? Filemon Yap Sotto, or Don Filemon (born on November 22, 1872 and died October 10, 1966) was one of Cebu's greatest political leaders during the times of Don Sergio Osmeña, Don Mariano Jesus Cuenco, Don Vicente Rama and other gentlemen of the old school. Don Filemon was a writer, orator, lawyer, newspaper publisher (publisher of such newspapers as El Imperial, And Kaluswasan, la Opinion and La Revolución).  He was a congressman of the third district of Cebu (now first district) from 1907 to 1916, and a senator from 1916 to 1922, and more famously, as the Head of the Seven Wise Men that wrote the 1935 Philippine Constitution. Vicente Yap Sotto, the younger brother, also called Don Vicente Sotto (born April 18, 1877 and died May 28, 1950), was also a congressman representing the second district (now Cebu City, Mandaue and Lapu-Lapu and the whole sixth district today) from 1922 to 1925, and senator from 1946 to 1950. He was the principal author of the Press Freedom Law, otherwise called the Sotto Law. He is the grandfather of senate president Tito Sotto, Vicente Sotto III. He was just 22 years old when he put up the first newspaper in Cebu published by a Filipino citizen, La Justicia. It is in his honor that the old Southern Islands Hospital was renamed Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center, the biggest in the whole Visayas. Vicente Sotto III, or Tito Sen has been Quezon City vice mayor, president of the Vice Mayors' League and senators for four terms. He was senator for two consecutive terms from 1992 to 2004. Then he was elected again in 2010 to 2016 and from 2016 to 2022. He was elected senate president on May 22, 2018 and served until June 30, 2022. The Sottos have served the country well. They have given Cebu much honor and great inspiration. The Dutertes only made themselves famous as a political dynasty in Davao. They have not done much for Cebu. Why should Cebuanos support Sara over Tito Sotto? The Dutertes have already had a president, a mayor for a number of times, a vice mayor, a congressman for many terms. They made Davao famous and themselves even more prestigious. But they have not helped Cebu the way and extent that Tito Sotto and his forebears have done. President Duterte has not appointed any Cebuano to a major Cabinet position, not even to the COMELEC, COA or Civil Service Commission. All top positions have been given to either people from Davao or from San Beda. Cebuanos are not top of mind of the Dutertes. And so, why should Cebuanos support Sara? If the Dutertes do not consider Cebuanos important, why should Cebuanos give importance to Sara? With due respect, appointing the Liloan Mayor her spokesperson (who is not attending to such a job anyway) will not do Sara any good or give her any advantage. I have a strong feeling that Inday will not be number one in Cebu. She has not done anything worth supporting her candidacy. Love begets love and Inday did not love Cebu as much that Tito did."
1,"Res ipsa loquitor. This emerging phenomenon speaks for itself. The lawyers for Leni, and even the non-lawyers, too, are seeing a massive emergence of palpable, obvious and indubitable evidence of surges of exodus towards the camp of the winning candidate, Leni Robredo. This is going to continue till voting time. The dam has been broken, and giant waves of Leni support shall inundate the voting centers come May 9. Goodbye, BBM. The loyal supporters of Isko, Ping and Pacman are now gradually navigating towards the Pink direction, and many of them have already abandoned their hopeless voyages, and jumped ship to the pink ship of VP Leni. Their leaders are smelling defeat if they remain with Moreno, Lacson and Pacquiao. There are even loose factions in the BBM camps which are about to declare their break away from their ""weak leader"" and follow the path of a strongly-principled and straight fighter, Leni Robredo. Those who refuse to see the handwriting on the wall may wake up one day regretting their hesitancy. This exodus phenomenon started on March 24, when unexpectedly and out of nowhere, Partido Reforma chairman Pantaleon Bebot Alvarez, former House Speaker (ousted by the Sara and GMA conspiracy), and the unquestioned kingpin of Davao del Norte, along with the governor  Edwin Hubahib, declared their resignation from Reforma and their unanimous support for Leni Robredo, leaving Ping Lacson without a party. That Alvarez move opened the floodgates to other breakaways. That was the crucial tipping point, signaling the beginning of BBM's debacle. That was followed by Ikaw Muna Visayas Chapter's leaving Isko Moreno and shifting support to VP Leni. Led by Nick Malazarte, the group announced that they had seen that Isko's campaign was not achieving its targets and that the only hope to defeat the worst option was to align with the only viable opposition, no other than Leni Robredo. On April 12, Tim Orbos of the ""Nais Ko"" campaign group for Isko Moreno also announced that they are now shifting their support to VP Leni. He was joined by Ikaw Muna Pilipinas secretary general Elmer Argano. This is a big group of more than 800,000 which first convinced Isko to gun for the presidency. Their breakaway must be devastating to the Domagoso's campaign. The original and the genuine leaders of the Partido Federal Pilipinas led by its only legitimate party chairman Commissioner Abubakar Mangelen is reportedly poised to announced their own breakaway from the Marcos camp to join the Robredo campaign. Another faction of the highly questionable PDP Laban (so-called Cusi wing), the Zamboanga Chapter of Ikaw Muna, is also joining the Robredo camp. What does this phenomenon mean? Well, the answer is obvious: The Robredo campaign is now surging up and the people are seeing to what direction the political winds are blowing. And so, sorry to the governors and mayors who declared their support for BBM and Sara for obvious reasons. But many of them will be hit by the boomerang. The people may abandon them and also join the winning team of Leni. Kiko may not make it but Leni is surging up, up and up until May 9. Nobody is buying that fake sex video against Aika, and the people are getting angry at how the hopeless and the fearful losing camp is desperately doing to hold on to the straws of their hopeless dream. Soon, they are going to eat dust in defeat and ignominy. Or be inundated by the tidal waves of massive pink support for Leni."

1,"The principle of separation between the State and the Church simply means that the State cannot establish a religion and should allow the people to exercise their religious freedom, unstifled by state regulation. Our government is not like the United Kingdom that established the Church of England or like the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that mandates Islam as the only recognized religion. But does separation mean that Church leaders cannot exercise political rights? Remember the Filipino bishops and priests are also citizens of the republic. Their religious affiliations and positions do not deprive them of the rights to vote and even be voted upon, and for them to take political stands, especially if transcendental issues of utmost importance are involved. For instance, if the sacredness of human life and human dignity, as well as human rights are under attack, does the separation of church prohibit religious leaders from voicing out their dissent and disapproval of public policies that endanger life, liberty, and human freedom? I don't think so. We saw many leaders of the Church who took strong stands against the State, Remember Gomburza; Fathers Mariano Gomez, Jose Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora. They were executed by garrote on February 17, 1872 in Bagumbayan by the Spanish colonial authorities for alleged subversion and inciting to sedition. Well, I saw for myself how the late cardinal Jaime Sin challenged the Marcos regime and supported the revolt of General Fidel V. Ramos and Secretary Juan Ponce Enrile against the Marcos dictatorship. Cardinal Sin's call for people to march to EDSA was the tipping point that triggered the ouster of Marcos from Malacañang. Those were the moments when the Church fought the State and won. The Catholic Church, its hierarchy, its parishes and its various Church-mandated organizations, like the parish councils, the lay ministers, the Knights of Columbus, the Legions of Mary, the Catholic Women's League, the Mother Butlers Guild and many others do not publicly endorse candidates. But it is the moral duty of the Church and its instrumentality to help the faithful laity make conscientious choices, based on moral and ethical values that the Church teaches and advocates for; like honesty and integrity in public service, paying taxes to the government, not to be involved in drugs, and not being members of family dynasties that seek to monopolize political power, in direct derogation of the basic principles of democracy. If the Church does these, it is not in violation of the principle of separation. The Church and its leaders are not precluded from speaking on important issues like abortion, birth control, family planning, euthanasia, divorce, extra-judicial killing, drugs, social justice, the promotion of the common good, and honesty in government service. These do not violate the principle of separation. There were even a number of religious priests who ran for public office. The best example is Fr. Ed Panlilio of Pampanga who was elected governor when he ran precisely to fight against the drug problem in President GMA's home province. Well, Gregorio Aglipay was a Catholic priest, but he founded the Philippine Independent Church to protest against Rome. In Cebu, Fr. Miguel Kintanar ran and was elected a member of the Interim Batasang Pambansa. Fr. Andres Flores ran and won as delegate to the 1973 Constitutional Convention. In 2016, a priest, Fr. Leoncio Evasco Jr., lost by just a little above 2,000 votes to Art Yap. The consistent teachings of the Church does not prohibit Church leaders from being involved in politics. When issues of utmost importance are at stake, religious leaders should not tolerate evil to triumph by allowing good men to do nothing. The good people of God should speak up and do something. This is called for and being neutral is not an option. The forces of evil are working hard. Even Jesus Christ was pitted against Barabbas and lost in a dirty election that was heavily controlled by the trolls and manufacturers of fake news under the instigation of the scribes and Pharisees, and the Commission on Elections was the trapo Pontius Pilate. Jesus lost because his disciples and apostles did not take a stand. They could have said their piece and resisted like what Gomburza and Cardinal Sin did. And they need to move fast."
1,"If their ambitions find favor and certain particular candidates win the positions they aspire for, our country will become politically unique in a manner by which I cannot even put a name on. Some will find it absurd, others anomalous. Still others will find it sad, and then some embarrassing. Just for the heck of it I will just say it is more fun in the Philippines. If Bongbong Marcos wins, there will be a brother-sister team straddling the executive and legislative branches of government as his sister Imee Marcos is a sitting senator. If Mark Villar wins, we will have a mother-son tandem in the Senate, where mother Cynthia Villar was elected number one senator in 2019. If Alan Peter Cayetano wins, he will join sister Pia Cayetano, also elected in 2019. If Jejomar Binay wins, there will also be a father-daughter teamup in the Senate as he joins Nancy Binay who in 2019 made the Magic 12 by the skin of her teeth. She barely edged out JV Ejercito who, if he wins this time around, and provided brother Jinggoy Estrada also wins, will form half of a brother-brother tandem. Two Villars, two Cayetanos, two Binays, and two Ejercitos make eight, a third of the full Senate. That is not all. What if it is true what the rumors say that Senator Grace Poe is really a daughter of Ferdinand Marcos Sr.? That would make her the sister of Senator Imee Marcos, thereby creating a fifth family tandem in the Senate. Five pairs make 10 out of the 24-man Senate, just three short of a simple majority. They can make or unmake a quorum. They are a formidable bloc unto themselves. At the outset I said this makes for more fun in the Philippines. And why not? I would rather make the best out of a bad situation than mope and fret about something over which we have no control. In the Philippines, we have absolutely no control over who we elect into office. We do not have a hand on who files for candidacy for whatever position. We are at the mercy of those who think themselves able to lead us. It is not we the people who asked, urged, pleaded, cajoled, bribed, or wheedled politicians to run for office. It was they themselves, of their own volition, gumption, initiative, and imagination who decided they should run for public office. They were never our choices. But for whatever reason that a just and loving God allowed such a situation, it becomes up to us to make our choices out of those who chose themselves. That there are credible choices among the self-chosen ones is indeed a remarkable consolation. But there are also perplexing ones, candidates whose ability to even think they can run a country continues to defy all sense of logic, humor, or even prayer and piety. If they were irritations to the skin, they would be pimples upon a pimple, unscratchable itches that deny reach and location. Whether this setup, where we have no choice over our choices, is a punishment or just God having fun, I do not know. Maybe it is both. And the more I see bishops, priests, and nuns not getting any sleep politicking, the more I think this is so, I will just cite one example. Manny Pacquiao. What on earth is he thinking running for president? But then he claims God talked him into running. Who can argue with that? In closing, let me indulge myself in a little wishful thinking. Instead of being served a strange and unwanted platter, I long to see the day when, as in a restaurant, I can order what I really want. People should be able to recommend first their choices, and from the top, say 10 choices, a leader is then elected. That would be more in keeping with freedom to choose. But as Pinoys would have it, kapoy og kuti na kaayo na."
1,"What motivates one to run for political office? Is it pride, the perks of the position or service? Can one not serve without having to ran for office and spend so much to the point of wanting to earn at least two times over to make up for all the hardship and expense? To take on a political position anywhere in the world would entail a campaign that requires expense. This is not only in the Philippines. Although the numerous aspirants for the highest positions in the land is remarkable and is characteristic of the political climate in the country. To run for public office requires a lot of sacrifice actually, that is why there are those who have a heart for service that opt for other options to help rather than politics. As said, the office is public, thus one exposes one’s life to public scrutiny. It is no longer a selective Facebook post that will announce your life. But there will be varying views on how you are, your privacy will be invaded, your resources will be scrutinized, and no matter how clean you strive to be someone will still throw a stone at you. So why run for public office?  Here are some of the responses I got from some of the politicians I had the opportunity to speak with. I have tried to capture the essence of their intentions. There are those who get into politics because of family pressure. They are next in line.  Grandpa and Dad have done it, and at a certain point Mom, so why not the next hijo? So the son joins albeit reluctantly in the beginning, and then enjoys the dynamism of the office, and even develops a heart for the people and a cause. And if fortunate, the power that goes with the position does not take away the grounding, though most often, when it is a dynasty, there is that sense of entitlement that takes a conscious effort to eradicate. If the politician is wise, and sincere, he can work with the right focus, otherwise, it will just be a ride until the next election. For others it is simply ego. The need to be in a position of power. The need to be known.  There is that illusion when one still a bystander that there is a lot of money in public office. And that is when things go wrong. There will be money if you make money out of others. But there is really no money. Just the freedom to spend what is budgeted for projects that your constituents need. Or to your favor if you want, like roads leading to your property. But if that is all that you are after, you will realize at the end of the day, it is not worth three or so years of pressure. Some get into politics because there is a certain discontent. A prodding and unresolved issue. This is what usually triggers the party list or a councilor; people in the legislative office who want to make laws for change and development, or an executive position that wants to effect progress. Some do it because they feel they have something to give, to share. Whether it be an expertise or a way of doing things. Systems that help improve the management of government. “If you are in government, you can effect changes utilizing the human resources that are made available to you,” one politician said. “We really need to change the old practices and move into new thinking. We need to influence the mindset of the traditional politicians, slowly push, and adjust without compromising your core,” he added. “Old families get absorbed with their own parochial style of leadership. We need change, new, good leaders,” he concluded. For most, it is best not to lose focus on the real objective of joining politics. And hopefully that should be favorable to improving the conditions of the country and the people.  For I would like to believe that today’s Filipino is better informed, better empowered, and more discerning. It is my prayer then, that those who make it through the race have centered their intentions on the purpose of God for leadership. That way, they will be sure to complete the race."

Naging in-demand ngayon ang concert rallies upang makapagparami ng dadalo at makunan ng video at litrato para sa publicity. Isa sa pinakaepektibong mind conditioning propaganda ito sa social media. Matumal ba ang benta ng sibuyas ngayon? Ha-ha-ha! Kahit itanggi ng magkabilang political camp na ang karamihan sa mga dumadalo ay bayaran, wala na rin namang maniniwala. Marami naman ang umaamin at  lumalabas na ebidensiya nang abutan ng pera tuwing matatapos o bago magsimula ang mga patawag na rallies. Kaway-kaway lang para may maisaing at pang-ulam. Pagkatapos ng eleksyon, asahan na nating  babahain ng reklamo ang Comelec dahil sa bintangan ng dayaan at kikita naman ang mga linta sa loob ng opisina nila for further entertainment siyempre!"

1,"CEBU, Philippines —  The U.S. Embassy in Manila, along with the U.S. Consular Agency here in Cebu, has issued a reminder to American citizens to avoid participating in large rallies or crowds in line with the upcoming national and local elections on May 9. “As the election nears, we remind U.S. citizens that foreign nationals are prohibited by Philippine law from engaging in partisan political activities in the country,” part of the message reads. For their safety during the election period, foreign nationals, including U.S. citizens, are discouraged from participating in large rallies or crowds, it said. “Foreign nationals found engaging in a protest or mass demonstration could be considered in violation of their immigration status.” The message also elaborated on the safety measures to be observed throughout the election period for civilians. Meanwhile, earlier, the U.S Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has de-escalated the COVID-19 risk level for traveling to the Philippines to alert level 2. As per CDC, level 2 is considered a moderate level of COVID-19. Last February, the country was classified by the CDC under alert level 4 then downgraded to level 3 earlier this month and went down further to alert level 2. “Travelers are expected to be fully vaccinated before travel while unvaccinated travelers who are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are advised to avoid nonessential travel to this destination. If you must travel and have concerns, talk to your doctor,” the center said. CDC uses Travel Health Notices (THNs) to alert travelers and other audiences to health threats around the world as well as advise them on how to protect themselves. From a 3-level notice system, CDC then adopted a 4-level system for COVID-19 and updated the criteria used to determine THN levels on November 21, 2020.  — JMD (FREEMAN)"
1,"During the last year of President Noynoy Aquino in Malacañang, then presidential hopeful Mar Roxas exercised his undue influence on the president, and caused the creation of the Negros Island Region, separating Negros Oriental from Region 7 and Negros Occidental from Region 6. Today, that standalone island region no longer exists. President Rodrigo Duterte erased Mar's folly. Mar Roxas wanted to create a new Ilongo region, controlled by ultra-rich hacienderos, for the political advantage of the Liberal Party. But when President Duterte took over, such a geographic incongruity was forthwith undone. Negros Oriental had been reinstated to rejoin Cebu, Bohol, and Siquijor. Its life lasted only from May 29, 2015 to August 9, 2017. Negros Oriental's area is 5,385.33 square kilometers and with a population of 1,432,990 in 2020. It has six component cities, which are Dumaguete (the capital), Tanjay, Bais, Bayawan, Guihulngan, and Canlaon. It has three legislative districts, 19 municipalities, and 557 barangays. Its governor is Roel R. Degamo who belongs to the Nacionalista Party while the vice governor is Edward Mark L. Macias of the Liberal Party. The 1st District comprises the cities of Canlaon and Guihulngan, with seven towns (the population is 422,208), is represented by Jocelyn Sy Limkaichong. The 3rd District, covering the cities of Dumaguete, Bais, and Tanjay, and five towns (with a population of 508,152), is represented by Manuel T. Sagarbarria. The 3rd District, covering the city of Bayawan, seven towns, with a population of 424,635 (as of 2015), is represented by Arnolfo R. Teves, Jr. All the three congressmen have had two terms from 2016 to 2022). In 2016, presidential candidate Roxas won here with 246,765 votes to Duterte's 173,096, Poe's 86,017, Binay's 48,272, and Santiago’s, 9,116. Vice President Robredo won big here with 254,207 (much higher than Roxas), followed by Cayetano, 100,286; Marcos, 66,255; Escudero, 52,716; Trillanes, 21,157; and Honasan, 13,936. Dumaguete City also voted for Robredo, 27,109: Cayetano, 17,680; and Marcos only got 8,357. Canlaon voted Robredo, 11,666; Cayetano, 2,539; and Marcos a measly 2,415. Guihulngan voted Robredo 18,336; Cayetano, 4,486 and Marcos only 2,943. Tayasan voted Robredo 5,865; Cayetano, 1,715; Honasan, 1674; and Marcos (a poor fourth placer), 1,215. The NIR had these results for vice president: Robredo, 969,381; followed by a distant Marcos, 225,922; Escudero, 205,296; Cayetano, 205,296; Trillanes, 79,692; and Honasan, 27,851. I really can't imagine how Marcos can turn this around in 2022. Doc Mark Matias of the LP is challenging incumbent Roel Degamo of the NP for governor with Henry Teves, who belongs to NPC, and Ruel Degamo, an independent. Three bets are competing for vice governor: Erwin Macias of the Nationalist People’s Coalition, Guido Reyes of the NP, and independent Jose Munoz. Running for 1st District congressman is only incumbent Josy Limkaichong of the LP, who is running unopposed. The 2nd District is contested by George Arnaiz of Lakas, and Chiquiting Sagarbarria of the NPC. Four candidates are vying for the 3rd District's seat; Karen Estrella of Promdi, Rey Lopez of NP, Arnie Teves of the NPC, and independent candidate Acel Estrella. My random surveys done through my contacts indicate that VP Leni Robredo will win in Negros Oriental with a comfortable margin. Marcos is not even sure to get second place. Wait ‘til I share the Western Visayas projections. That region will give VP Leni a most probable lead of not less than a million votes over any and all of her rivals. Region 6 will be the tipping point. If other people have different views, I challenge them to bring them on, and let's debate on them. Let's not indulge in personalities but on the realities on the ground. Negros Oriental will join Cebu in making VP Leni win the presidency. Mark my words."
1,"If it were one-on-one, between Vice President Leni and BBM, the deciding regions are Regions 5, 6, and 7, and all the provinces here are poised to choose the vice president over Marcos in the May 9, 2022 polls. Facts do not lie, unless trolls are out to rewrite the truth. VP Leni garnered a lead of more than one million in Region 6 alone. In the elections of 2016, the team of Roxas and Robredo swept these five provinces of Panay: Iloilo, Aklan, Antique, Capiz, and Guimaras. In Aklan, Mar Roxas got 132,086; followed by Poe 51,943; Duterte, 51,816; Binay, 30,762; Santiago, 6,333; and Seneres 137. For vice president, Leni got 145,611; Marcos, 50,780; Escudero; 33,383; Cayetano, 18,967; Trillanes, 8,221; and Honasan, 5,300. Take note that in many instances in Panay, Leni got more votes than her standard bearer, Mar Roxas. I challenge the trolls to disprove this. In Antique, Roxas got 98,765; Poe, 60,280; Duterte, 44,702; Binay, 30,735; Santiago, 8,367; Seneres, 287. For vice president, Leni got 115,584; Marcos, 43,773; Escudero, 32,886; Cayetano, 16,643; Trillanes, 14,530; and Honasan, 5,566. This was the time when Leni was just a neophyte representative from Camarines Sur, while the Marcoses have been well-entrenched in power for more than 50 years, Now that VP Leni is the incumbent now. If she defeated Marcos in 2016, how much more today when the people have shown the very glaring superiority in qualifications of the vice president over the defeated candidate of 2016. Aklan has an area of 1,821.42 square kilometers, with 17 municipalities, and 327 barangays, no city, and a population 615,475. Its governor is Florence Miraflores and the vice governor is Reynaldo Quimpo. The congressmen are NPC's Carlito Marquez, for the 1st District and Teodorico Haresco, NP of the 2nd District. Antique is bigger in area of 2,729.17 sq. km., 18 towns and 590 barangays, but with a slightly smaller population of 612,974. The governor is Rhodora Cadiao and the vice governor is Edgar Denosta. They are both of NUP. Antique is represented by former senator Loren Legarda, deputy speaker. For 2022, in Aklan, running for governor are PDP Laban's Jose Miraflores, KBL's William Lachica, and independent Rayam Torres. In Antique, NUP's Rhodora Cadiao, the incumbent, is being challenged by PDP Laban's Vicente Feledicio and independent Mayong Petinglay. What matters most in any election is the bottom line: Whoever wins, will the people gain or will they be burdened with more pain? My own prognosis is that with VP Leni as president, Aklan, Antique, and the whole Philippines will be much better off than with another Marcos in power."
1,"Since late last year, probably in early December, former Cebu City mayor Tomas Osmeña, whose wife Margot, a councilor, is seeking the mayorship in this year's May 9 general elections, started surfacing again in the news. As a public figure, this is not surprising. What raises the eyebrows is his chosen vehicle to get back into the public consciousness and be a factor in his wife's political ambitions. Osmeña, believe it or not, has positioned himself as champion for vendors. Sorry but I just cannot fall for this ruse. And neither should the Cebuanos for whom this play is clearly being acted out. Osmeña is probably the last person anyone would associate with vendors. I do not have the space to go into detail but those who remember the Sto. Nino vendors and a hapless Lahug barbecue vendor will know what I mean. Now, conveniently as the elections get closer, Osmeña is in the thick of opposition by some vendors to the modernization of the Carbon market, a project undertaken by the Cebu City government in partnership with a private firm. He has promised to provide the oppositors free legal services should they get into trouble. To me, this provides encouragement to make the situation in Carbon more tense than it already is. That reelectionist Mayor Michael Rama stands as a formidable stumbling block to the burning desire of the Osmeñas to retake City Hall is what gives the involvement of Osmeña with vendors perfect sense. Otherwise, like oil and water, Osmeña and the vendors just do not mix. Sadly, because some vendors just cannot accept change nor see beyond the short term, they cannot appreciate that they are just being used. What is even sadder is that there are other groups that are clearly also exploiting the vendors for their own goals. I would not be surprised if communist front organizations are at the center of the agitation. It helps fuel the communist narrative of oppression if trouble erupts in Carbon and the hand of the state is forced to instill order. The vendors in this regard are nothing more than sacrificial lambs in the altar of ideology. Last Monday, a scuffle broke out between protesting vendors and market authorities trying to set up steel barriers meant to make movement easy and orderly. That little children were placed in the frontlines of protest is a jaded fingerprint of organized agitation rather than spontaneous objection. And what is so unreasonable in the plan for vendors to move to temporary facilities to allow work on the project to proceed? Only those who approach the Carbon situation with agendas other than the ultimate betterment of all would find the project and its attendant short-term inconveniences, whether real, imagined or trumped up, unreasonable and objectionable. Those who see the long-term benefits of a modern, clean, safe, and orderly Carbon would surely be willing to make the temporary sacrifice. The vendors must try to understand that there is no escaping the march of progress. Modernization is part of continuing and inescapable change. They have to accept that they do not live in a vacuum and must, therefore, learn to adapt to change. If it is any consolation in face of the disruptive character of change, at least it is government, their government, that is in charge, and would always look out for their interests. Other interest groups and politicians only look out for what they can benefit from. If the vendors want any evidence, the fact that those meddling in Carbon are showing their faces only now when it is convenient for their own purposes is proof enough that they are merely being used. They are no more than props of those who have larger goals than commiserating with vendors."
1,"We see videos of crowds in political rallies one after the other on social media. Taken from the top or from the sides, showing a large crowd of supporters, as we often see during religious parades or large festivals. And the sole reason for displaying this is to demonstrate the broadest possible support. And this will in any case influence the thoughts of people who are still indecisive about which candidate or party will be able to attract the largest audience. With so many streets and avenues covered, one would wonder how a single gathering can draw such a large throng. Although we have seen huge audiences at large events in the past, such as the burial of assassinated former Senator Benigno ""Ninoy"" Aquino in 1983. Another example would be papal visits, which resulted in long lines of devotees on the streets. These occurrences demonstrate an unimaginable level of patronage and devotion. Returning to political gatherings, each party claims a particular number of attendees and attempts to undermine the size of the opposing party's crowd. However, we cannot say with certainty that the size of the crowd will correspond to the actual number of votes cast on election day. Because if we go by the size of the crowds at the rallies, other candidates may be considering quitting. Other candidates, on the other hand, would be content to court their voters in public places such as markets. As a result, there is no way to estimate the size of the crowd in this manner. For some voters, attending a political event may no longer be a realistic option due to safety concerns. For one thing, the Covid virus is still a continual menace. Two, for those of us who are physically challenged due to advanced age, such as myself, participating in such a rally may put our lives in jeopardy. Finally, we can already learn about certain candidates' platforms, strategies, and initiatives through television debates, news, and a variety of other sponsored conferences. Supporters that attend large political rallies bring a great deal of patience, courage, and commitment with them. It requires fortitude to confront such a large number of hazards among a gathering of strangers for an extended period of time. Leaving yourself up to the possibility that others will foment fear and unrest in the area. Given that we still have a little over a month until the national election, we can expect more big political rallies to dominate the news. Rallies are a staple of every election because they allow candidates to be heard and seen in person in front of a much larger crowd in the hopes that the same crowd will turn out in the voting precincts and help their candidates achieve their goals. At the end of the day, the most important thing is that we will not be fooled by figures. We don't want to be a part of the sea of blindness; instead, we'd like to be among the few who have been awakened. After all, an election is a popularity contest in which candidates attempt to win by manipulating the emotions of the electorate. However, we must rely on the increased knowledge and participation of our citizens, who are equally worried about their future. Always vote for principle, even if we are alone in our voting, and embrace the finest thought that our vote is never lost."
1,"The Ilonggos this time have the chance to make history. This is the region, together with Central Visayas, that will cause Leni to win over BBM. Yes, one of the regions that reject Bongbong Marcos and prefer VP Leni is the western Visayas, led by Iloilo. This trend appears to continue in this year's elections. The trajectory is pointing clearly to an inevitable direction. Marcos will be defeated here and resoundingly. In 2016, Mar Roxas and Leni Robredo dominated the elections in Iloilo. Roxas got 657,940, followed by Poe 166,480, and Duterte was third with 146,294, Miriam, 59,754 (well for sentimental reasons, and love for the native lady from Dumangas), Binay, 37,430 and Seneres, 748. For VP, Robredo got a staggering 1,267,977 votes (double than the votes of her standard bearer, Roxas who is from this region), followed by a poor Marcos with a measly 127,434,; Escudero, 89,071; Cayetano, 57,260; Trillanes, 45,086 and Honasan 13,604. Iloilo gave Robredo more votes than her home region, Region 5.This time, it can be more. Iloilo is the premier province of Region 6. This is the home of senators Franklin Drilon and the late Miriam Defensor Santiago. Iloilo towers among the five provinces of Panay Island, which includes Aklan, Antique, Capiz, and Guimaras. Iloilo was founded in 1566. It is a very rich province and heavily populated. Its area is smaller than Negros Occidental but slightly bigger than Cebu and Negros Oriental. It has an area of 5,000.81 square kilometers with one independent city, Iloilo, and one component city, Passi, and 42 towns and 1,721 barangays. Its population is 2,051,899 (more than a million less than Cebu's). The current governor is from the third district, Arthur R Defensor, Jr (son of a former governor with the same name), and the vice governor is Christine S. Garin from the first district. The first district covers seven towns with 374,726 population and is represented by former Health secretary Janette L. Garin. The second district comprises eight towns, with a population of 313,112 and with Michael B. Gorriceta as representative.  The third district, covering nine towns with 434,142 population, is represented by my former UST College of Law student, lawyer Lorenz R. Defensor, brother of the governor. He was in the same class under me with Speaker Lord Alan Velasco. The fourth district covering the component city of Passi and seven towns, with a population of 378,502 is represented by Braeden John Q. Biron. By the way, this is the district of senators Drilon and Defensor who came from Dumangas. The fifth district covering 11 towns in the north (bordering Aklan), with a population of 451,116 is represented by Raul C. Tupas. The lone district of Iloilo City with a population of 447,992 is represented by Julienne L. Baronda. For this year's elections, Governor Defensor is being challenged by an independent Noli Gil and  incumbent mayor  Jerry Trenas, NUP is being challenged by Jun Capulot of PRP and independent Vicente Ang. The incumbents are poised to win again. For representatives of the city's lone district, two Barrondas (Rudy and Jamjam)  and two Espinosas Joe and Juni are fighting among themselves. Janette Garin is facing Vic Tabaquirao, PDP Laban. Michael Gorriceta is challenged by Dennis Hereso, Aksyon. Lorenz Defensor is facing independent Ed Artazona. In the fourth, Ferjenel Biron is facing Reynaldo Galeno and Antonio Parcon. Raul Tupas is being challenged by LP's Niel Tupas, his cousin. Whatever will happen at the local level, Leni Robredo is poised to dominate Iloilo come May 9 polls. Marcos will eat the dust in Iloilo, despite (or even because of)  the all-out support of the Garins. What matters most however, is the welfare of the people. Much more than the politicians, will the poor have better hopes after the polls? It is VP Leni who cares more for the people, much more what the Garins have done, if any. The Ilonggos are smart people like the Cebuanos. They know who is fake and who is real."
1,"This May 9 is no longer just the day we elect new national and local political leaders. Since bishops, priests, and nuns have chosen to be actively involved in the political campaign, to the point of wearing the colors of their preferred presidential candidate and allowing political activities to be held inside churches on this candidate's behalf, then election day 2022 may as well be a referendum on their persons and actions. The Philippines is more than 80% Catholic. But I have long suspected that this continued strength and growth of Catholicism in the country are drawn mainly from a deep, abiding, and genuine faith in God and have absolutely nothing to do with any shepherding genius that its bishops, priests, and nuns may possess, if at all. I just did not have the means and the opportunity to validate these suspicions. But the May 9, 2022 general elections can very well serve that purpose. With bishops, priests, and nuns openly and actively campaigning for a particular candidate, the result of the elections would, in no uncertain terms, tell the world, and the Pope himself, just how effective these men and women of the cloth are in shepherding the Catholic flock toward a particular direction. The bishops, priests, and nuns have depicted the May 9 election in the Philippines as a war between good and evil, with their candidate for president as leader of the forces of good, and the leading rival as leader of the bad. They arrogated unto themselves the ultimate power of God to judge people by calling this rival the son of a killer, a member of a family of thieves. They have taken to calling the supporters of their candidate's main rival as dull and ignorant, sinners just like their principal. They have divided the country between their ""good"" candidate and the rest of the field, especially the leading ""bad"" contender, who in their eyes must be condemned to hell. Consumed by political passion, they ignored the sacrilegious depiction in a poster of their candidate as standing beside Jesus. To be sure, the bishops, priests, and nuns have not mentioned their candidate by name. But when they wear ribbons on their chests, tie bands on their arms, and put on masks that are of a particular color that is unmistakably that of their candidate, how much more unambiguous can you get? When they allow their candidate's posters to be displayed in churches and on their vehicles, how much more open can they get? There would have been no problem if bishops, priests, and nuns stuck to the generic sense of what is good and evil because, as shepherds, that is precisely what they are supposed to do. In fact they ought to be encouraged and congratulated if they did that. But when they started attaching political color to their vocation and became very open and direct in their political choices, they effectively became partisans, not shepherds. And since they have become partisans and active political participants, then they can no longer escape the implications of the May 9 results. If their chosen candidate wins, then they can claim great success in their shepherding duties. They can say they have snatched the Filipino people from the jaws of evil and darkness. They can rest easy the faithful still trust their bishops, priests, and nuns on matters of good and evil. But if their ""good"" candidate loses to the ""evil"" rival, then that can only mean the 80% plus Catholics do not trust their bishops, priests, and nuns to tell them what is right from wrong. Such failure should be cause for massive self-introspection. If faith itself remains strong, and the message still credible, then maybe it is the messenger who has lost the moral authority to deliver Jesus to the hearts of all of us sinners."
1,"MANILA, Philippines — Angat si Vice President Leni Robredo sa mga katunggali sa pulitika batay sa resulta ng independent study sa mga Pilipinong hindi pa nakaranas na ma-survey para sa darating na halalan na taliwas sa resulta ng mga nalathalang survey. Kinuha ng Brand-Y Research and Market Intelligence ang 1,200 Pilipino na hindi pa nakaranas ma-survey bilang kalahok sa pag-aaral na ginawa mula Pebrero 16 hanggang 28, 2022. Sa nasabing pag-aaral, tinanong ang mga kalahok sa pamamagitan ng online questionnaire kung sino ang kanilang iboboto bilang Pangulo at Bise Presidente sa halalan sa Mayo. Ginamit ng pag-aaral ang tinatawag na psychographic identifier para sa mga kahalok: Medyo Hirap Pa Sa Buhay (SEC DE), Ok Naman Hindi Mahirap Hindi Mayaman (SEC C), at Komportable At Nakaka-Angat-Angat Na Ang Pamilya (SEC A,B). Batay sa kabuuang resulta ng pag-aaral, makukuha ni Robredo ang 53 porsiyento ng kabuuang boto habang pumapa­ngalawa si Bongbong Marcos na mayroon lang 37 porsiyento pagdating ng halalan."
1,"SA palagay ko, may gustong palabasin ang mga political operator, political strategist, political tactician, mga spin doctors na ang turing nila sa publiko ay parang washing machine, tsinutsubibo. Pansinin n’yo, gamit ang kanilang mga visual narra­tives sa iba’t ibang probinsiya at siyudad sa kanilang mga political sortie, mapapa-wow ka talaga sa balita or should I say, storytelling. Simple lang, mind conditioning with subliminal message­ gamit ang mga visual narratives o drone shot na nag­pa­pakita ng kapal ng tao na dumalo sa kanilang political sortie­, ang tawag dito. Nakatago ang kanilang mensahe o “subli­­minal message na ang mga “dumog pics” na ito ay mabi­sang pangontra sa survey na milya-milya ang layo. Pa­nabla, para may dahilan silang mag-alburoto kapag sila’y natalo sa eleksiyon. Kung ganoon, puwede nilang ideklara na failure of election. Tanong ulit, sino naman ang nagpa-fact-check sa mga nakaka-wow o nakakamanghang litrato, drone shots ng libu-libong supporters sa election rally? Sinong maka­ka­pagsabi na ang kanilang kuwento o narratives ay maaring may katotohanan o may kaunting dagdag at may kaunting bawas? Ang lumalabas kasi, kapag hindi ka nila kahanay, ikaw ang fake news, sila ang puwedeng i-fact-check ka. Isa lang ang puwedeng lumutang, lahat lubog na, lunod pa. Kumbaga, dapat isang kulay lang. Ang lagay eh, dapat there will only be one superstar? Nasaan ang ibang election rally ng mga kandidato? Wa epek na kasi ang mga soundbytes sa entablado, nananawa na raw ang mga tao sa kanilang mga ipinapa­ngako sa entablado pati na rin ang paninira sa kanilang mga katunggali. Tapos ang resulta, kulelat pa rin. Kaya ang labanan ngayon ay visual narratives, consistent at cons­tant para tuluy-tuloy ang mind conditioning. Malay mo nga naman­, makalamang din."
1,"Politicians from southern Cebu are multi-billionaires. But thousands of people there live below the poverty line. One Cebu is a sham. There are really many Cebus, the ones for the rich and famous, ones for the overtaxed middle class, and the rest for the poor. Politicians remember them only every election and disaster. Equal protection is only a principle. Equality is only a theory. The hard reality on the ground is that not everyone is created equal. Even Abraham favored Isaac over Ishmael, and Isaac favored Esau over Jacob, but the latter stole the rights of Esau and became the father of the 12 tribes of Israel. Even Jacob favored Joseph, son of his first wife, Leah. That also applies to the distribution of development among the seven districts of Cebu. The 7th District is the least favored. As if it is the most distant and least loved. The 1st District has three cities and three first-class towns, with the highest revenues and biggest population. The 2nd District is also least favored but has two first-class towns, Argao and Dalaguete. Among the two least-favored districts, the 2nd District is more blessed than the 7th District. The 3rd District is the biggest in area and most promising with one city and seven big municipalities, a shipping industry, a gold, and a copper mine. The 4th District also has a city and eight big rich towns. The 5th District has one city and 10 well-off municipalities, with a large area almost double that of the 4th District and larger than the 7th District. The 6th District is the smallest in area but one of the richest. In the olden times, Ronda and Dumanjug belonged to the 6th District, along with Barili, Aloguinsan, Pinamungajan, and Toledo. When I came of age, the kingpin of the 6th District was the so-called ""squeaking impertinence"" (as coined by President Carlos P. Garcia) but famous trial lawyer, Manuel Zosa. The old 5th District, from Boljoon of the east to Alcantara of the west (prior to the 1987 Charter) had representatives Troadio Galicano, Mariano Jesus D. Cuenco, Tomas N. Alonso, Miguel Cuenco, Leandro A. Tojong, Miguel D. Cuenco, Antonio V. Cuenco, and Emerito S. Calderon (father of today's seventh district Peter John Calderon). The old 4th District called SAAD (Sibonga, Argao, Alcoy, and Dalaguete) had representatives Alejandro Ruiz, Isidoro Aldanese, Juan F. Alcazaren, Agustin Kintanar, Vicente Rama, Agustin Y. Kintanar, Filomeno C. Kintanar, and Gaudencio Beduya. Then Congress was replaced by a unicameral and regional batasang Pambansa. Under the 1987 Constitution, the 2nd District of Cebu was composed of 15 towns, the ADABOSS in the east or Argao, Dalaguete, Alcoy Boljoon, Oslob, Santander, and Samboan, and the DRAMMBAG in the west: Dumanjug, Ronda, Alcantara, Moalboal, Malabuyoc, Badian, Alegria, and Ginatilan. But it was split into two: ADABOSS became the 2nd District, DRAMBAGG became the 7th District, with 141 barangays and with a total population (as of 2015) of 214,364, the smallest among the seven districts. ADABOSS has 142 barangays and a population of 239,820 as of 2015. The splitting of the atom was a gerrymandering concoction of then congressman Pablo Garcia of the 3rd District and Willy Caminero of the 2nd District. I called it Garciameandering and Caminerondering. The undivided 2nd District used to be represented by muro ami fishing magnate Sol Abines, Simeon L. Kintanar, Pablo P. Garcia, and Willy S. Caminero. Today, the 7th District is represented by Peter John Calderon, grandson of the old 1st District's (now 5th District) Don Ramon M. Durano. No matter what they say, the 7th District is the least developed and remembered only during disasters and elections. Even Ace Durano, who is from the 5th District, all of a sudden, has come down from his exalted position to help his cousin Peter John Calderon in Alegria. But of course, he is running for governor. He may give the 7th District a better Cebu. Most of the people are poor, while only the politicians are very rich. With all the contrasts, the long-held dichotomies, how can we truly say, there is only One Cebu? It pains me to say that I do come from Cebu's most forgotten, least developed, and poorest district. This is the district that produced the original idea of breaking away from the imperialistic north and the forgetful provincial capital. It is an irony that both the governor and the vice governor come from the south."
1,"The late US president John F. Kennedy once said: ""Mothers may still want their favorite children to grow up and become the president of the land...but they do not want them to become politicians in the process.” This is a very intriguing statement that needs proper discernment. Although, there is nothing wrong to gather this wish from ambitious parents for their offspring to attain the seat of the highest office in the government someday. Perhaps, what can also draw our attention is the background motive of these forebears in influencing the future of their scions who would transform into adults to experience the grueling challenges of presidency. In layman's perspective and in most realities, it is very difficult to divorce being a public servant and not a politician in actions, just like any person who is immersed in the quagmires of the omnipresent politics at home, church, community organizations and, of course, the government. As Google puts it: A politician is professionally involved in politics, especially as a holder or a candidate for an elected office. And as a person who acts in a manipulative and devious way to gain advancement within an organization. Politics as we can observe is funny, dirty, and risky. Funny, for the fact that there are those who always register because of their family names every election time, (even if they are not qualified), show their faces in the campaign paraphernalia, while some others are upholding shrewdly the gains of a dynasty. Dirty, for in realities the bad and the ugly ones will always prevail because of guns, goons, and gold while relegating the good candidates to simmer in defeat. Indeed, politics is imaged as a business and greedy adventure to expect something in return from a service coated with lies, vested interests, and pretentions. And risky, for the fact the politicians expose their lives and personalities themselves to untimely deaths, sickness, tiresome campaign sorties, visits, mudslinging, and fake news. During campaign periods, the voters are not always assured of the rosy promises to stop shady deals, drugs, and crime. These very citizens cannot expect total accomplishments and good developments on taxation, healthcare, education, infrastructures, tourism, employment, food stability, debts, foreign relations, and sound investments. If there are failures, the electorates can adversely create officials who are bossy, arrogant, liars, and corrupt. When allegations of mismanagement are proven true, the officials are thick-faced to retain their jobs and wait for healing time when the citizens seem to forget and dwell on court victories dominated by maneuvers and technicalities. On the other hand, some foreign countries have officials who resign, go abroad, and commit suicide. With prayers of hope, unity, and determination, this crucial stage will still expect a miracle to mold politicians to abandon the bad reputation and instead, religiously uphold the Constitution, rule of law, sound values and the Ten Commandments. These maybe are better said than done, but hopefully these can be done. Lito Gador Tampus Moalboal, Cebu"
1,"The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning is on the rise in many organizations across various fields. AI has the power to help businesses as well as employees by providing greater data insights, better threat protection, more efficient automation and other advances. However, if misused, AI can be a detriment to individuals, organizations, and society overall. For instance, “bots” are now rampant among social media, generating political propaganda or “fake news” intended to adversely impact or unjustly inflate people’s opinions of various political candidates or personalities, thereby lowering the quality of discourse and public faith in reporting institutions. Therefore, it is imperative to establish moral guidelines and boundaries for the use of AI in business, and possibly beyond. Organizations will have to rely on the skills and expertise of machine learning (ML) engineers and AI architects. The position of Artificial Intelligence Architect requires individuals with impeccable technical and engineering backgrounds, as well as the ability to see the big, overarching picture of a world supported by AI. Incorporating AI into everyday lives of people, including their personal, career, and business activities, requires an individual with vision and the capability to implement it successfully. Machine learning is a critical component of AI. Machine learning refers to a software’s ability to learn and therefore predict certain outcomes much like a human brain. And for businesses to make AI work, they require Machine Learning Engineers responsible for building and maintaining AI algorithms. Machine learning engineers must able to think critically and possess the ability to problem-solving. Having said this, you may be interested to read the following story of the TheFutureParty, claiming that the newly elected South Korean president enlisteddeep fake doppelganger to get the youth vote. As per TheFutureParty, newly elected South Korean president Yoon Suk-yeol, won over the youth vote by creating an AI avatar of himself that his campaign controlled to make videos. The result: a politician that appeared more charming than the real man may actually be. With Yoon’s victory showing that the tech works, politicians in other nations may try to do the same thing… unless lawmakers act fast to outlaw official deepfakes. Funny, likable, artificial. •People Power Party candidate Yoon Suk-yeol developed an AI copy of himself to be used by his campaign team to answer people’s questions and debate opponents. •The purpose of the AI Yoon was to program a version of himself that would appeal more to younger voters (Yoon is 61) by appearing wittier and smoother. •The videos of AI Yoon (more than 80 clips) went viral in South Korea, clocking over 14.5 million views, and raised his popularity with 20-somethings over ten percentage points. Authenticity or optimization? Here’s something that will make your head spin even more: during the campaign, People Power Party head Lee Jun-seok said, “Yoon is learning from his AI Yoon messages.” Translation: his AI double is a more effective politician than he is. And in another bit of irony, AI Yoon team-head Baik Kyeong-hoon said that the goal of the avatar was for voters to see “the human side of Yoon — not the stern image he projects on television.” At first, the ruling Democratic Party and President Lee Jae-myung criticized the use of an AI clone as “fraudulent and “a threat to democracy.” But when the polls started going up for Yoon, they developed their own avatar of Lee. After this interesting FutureParty story, you will agree that it is imperative to establish moral guidelines and boundaries for the use of AI in business, and possibly beyond. I feel a bit scared about what AI can do and how we can potentially be manipulated in the wrong direction if we don’t control the AI Architects and the MI Engineers. I am really interested in your views. Contact me at [email protected]"
1,"When the election season begins, we see some patterns and prevailing political opinions in the family, which we enjoy because it amplifies what we believe in, but we cannot ignore the reality that there are one or two opposing viewpoints in the family. Of course, this does not imply that when they express their opposite viewpoints, they are insulting our voice or influence, particularly us adult family members. A case in point is when our children voice their opinions on various issues, as well as their choices for political candidates. At first, we interpret it as a slight or a lack of influence over their decisions. The strong influence of social media, which they are heavily exposed to, has inculcated certain attitudes and generalizations in their consciousness. And these young people appear to be passionate about their opinions and beliefs, particularly when they show concern about the quality of their future. As a result, this is acceptable since they want to be involved in topics that will define their future. When we demand respect from them based on our age, they, in turn, deserve respect. As a result, this is acceptable since they want to be involved in topics that will define their future. When we ask for their respect based on our age, they, in turn, deserve respect in this situation. But when can we truly say that they require a greater understanding of a problem? When can we use our knowledge and expertise to help them think critically so that they can make decisions based on facts and good intentions rather than popularity? The results of a college class discussion that led to an informal and quick survey of presidential candidate preferences are both surprising and depressing. Disappointing in the sense that the reasons and sources for such a choice are dependent on social media popularity, particularly from vlogs, the bulk of which have been identified as being funded by some candidates to push their political agenda. Only then do we see the reasons for such differences in an atmosphere where we want all angles, views, preferences, and orientations to be heard. It is only then that we are able to comprehend where they are coming from. However, we must continue to listen and grasp where the differences exist, as well as address some assumptions and falsehoods, because here is where lies thrive. And thus, in the eyes of someone with a shaky foundation of truths, lies that are repeated over and over become true. When arguing for respect for one's opinion, it becomes more challenging. It's even more challenging when these viewpoints are based on long-held assumptions and biases rather than on well-established facts. Influencing and changing people's minds and beliefs requires patience and perseverance. However, for our young who are often open-minded, providing a thorough and thoughtful assessment of the past would eventually allow them to ground their thoughts and opinions in reality. Before we can fully go forward, we must take the time to look back and learn from our mistakes. Our differing perspectives highlight the need for understanding unique orientations and persuasions, but we must eventually come together in our pursuit of lasting peace, prosperity, and equality."
1,"I was invited last week by Cebu City Councilor Alvin Dizon and the Institute of Politics and Governance (IPG) to a community validation-presentation of the IPG’s initiative to scan local policies that protect women migrant workers. The IPG, in partnership with the UN Women Safe and Fair Philippines Programme and the Office of Councilor Dizon, has been working to contribute to making labor migration safe and fair for all women in the country. In 2020, the IPG through its Safe and Fair program conducted a study that looked into the intersections between migration and violence against women (VAW). The IPG aimed to identify the policies and programs of local government units in selected areas including Cebu City. The one I attended last March 1 was part of the series of activities that aim to advance at the local level the rights and welfare of women migrant workers. This is a timely yet often-overlooked topic compared to the more exciting news about war and conflict or the pandemic. In fact, migrant workers have been severely affected by pandemic and wars, with Asia’s overseas migrant workers being the first to lose their jobs. Others are exposed to harsh conditions but still hang on to their jobs knowing that life back home in a pandemic-battered economy can be harsher. IPG’s presentation revealed that the cities covered by the research, namely Marikina, Angeles, Urdaneta, Bacolod, Cebu and Davao, have existing policies pursuant to national policies related to migration and violence against women. IPG sees this as basis for an enabling policy environment toward the goal of protecting women migrant workers. Cebu City, for example, does not fall short in the number and quality of ordinances or policies related to migration and women’s rights protection. These are Ordinance No. 2163 (Implementing the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act), Ordinance No. 1666 which created the Cebu City Women’s and Family Affairs Commission, Ordinance No. 1881 or the Gender and Development Code of Cebu City, and Ordinance No. 2431 which institutionalized the End Violence Against Women and Children Fund in the city. Last year, the Cebu City Council also passed an ordinance authored by Councilor Dizon that would streamline services for OFWs. The IPG, however, observed that local policies are not informed by data due to the absence of systematic data collection on gender-based violence against women migrant workers. It likewise observed that while programs and services are in place, these lack coherence in implementation. The VAW reporting forms do not take into account women’s migration behavior and the role of civil society organizations, suggesting the lack of multi-sectoral collaboration in the entire referral system. A major stumbling block that the IPG found is limited resources and staff capacity. At the end of the day, the effectivity of these policies rests with the leadership at City Hall. Regardless of how an ordinance looks good on paper, if the executive lacks political will and bias for actions that protect the vulnerable and less-empowered sectors of society, then there will be wide gaps in policy and implementation. I think it’s time for Cebu City to have a woman leader at the helm of City Hall, especially one who has a track record in sectoral coordination and cooperation on the issue of women and children’s rights and welfare."
1,"CEBU, Philippines —  “Utterly nonsensical and clearly political.” This was how couple, Cebu Fifth District Rep. Duke Frasco and Liloan Mayor Christina Frasco, described the complaint against them before the Ombudsman for alleged irregularities in the donation of ambulances. “Ambulances save lives. Their refusal to accept the ambulances is what gravely endangers the public now deprived of the services of these life-saving vehicles,” they said in a statement released on March 5, 2022. Barangay Captains in Danao City, Don Roel Arias of Poblacion and Joselito Cane of Looc, have said that the ambulances placed their barangays and residents in grave mortal danger because “recipients are unprepared and lack of competence, expertise and knowledge to operate the same, making the whole project useless and a waste of precious public funds.” They said the vehicles were delivered to their barangays without their presence and their personnel were allegedly forced to receive the ambulances on behalf of the barangay. Arias and Cane said they declined the donation because they were not ready to operate an ambulance unit. They also took offense that the vehicles were printed with the words, TEAM FRASCO and Congressman Duke Frasco. “This showed the unabashed and outrageous claims and postures of the respondents to utilizes the properties for their personal interests and gain for the furtherance of the political pursuits of Team Frasco, the political and electoral team of respondents Frasco,” their 23-page complaint reads. In their statement, the Frasco couple said the turnover of the ambulances had the full authority of the Cebu Provincial Government. In fact, personnel of the Provincial General Services Office were present at that time and have all requisite documents proving such authority. The ambulances were procured with the use of funds from the national government that Duke facilitated to be downloaded to the provincial government. “Following the logic of the Captains and their principals, apparently it is now illegal for the duly elected representative of the Fifth District of Cebu to serve his constituents in Danao City by providing much needed emergency vehicles, and for his one and only wife to accompany him,” they said. They pointed out that the barangay captains’ refusal to allow help to reach the people of Danao has reportedly been consistent — from pandemic aid, dressed chickens, livelihood assistance, solar streetlights, covered courts, and other public infrastructure. “They would rather that the people suffer than receive help,” the statement reads, adding, “in truth, the only illegality here is in the taking and continued unauthorized possession of the ambulances out of the spite of bitter political defeat.” The barangay captains said the Frasco couple violated Republic Act (RA) 6713 or the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees and RA 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act in relation to the Administrative Code of the Philippines and the Republic Act 7160 otherwise known as the Local Government Code of the Philippines. Duke is seeking reelection against former Fifth District Representative Ramon “Red” Durano VI. Frasco defeated Durano in the 2019 local and national elections. — JMO (FREEMAN)"
1,"With political groups in Cebu reporting the results of so-called surveys favoring their respective candidates, the question of what to make of such conflicting results should be easy to answer. Who made the survey? Do they have a credible track record? Who funded the survey? What are the sampling methods? What does the survey ask? If the answer to any of those is not clear, then take the results of the survey with a grain of salt. Pre-election surveys aim to measure voters’ preference before election day. They are used to measure voter opinion, to know where the candidates are situated in the race, and to some extent help explain what voters think of the issues and the candidates. On the other hand, pre-election surveys are also criticized for promoting a horse-race coverage of elections, with news media emphasizing the candidates’ positions in the race instead of the issues that they stand for. There were proposals long ago to ban not the conduct but the publication of election survey results. Proponents of the ban argue that the publication of the results of pre-election surveys might create a bandwagon effect in favor of candidates who are doing well in such polls. Some also fear that pre-election surveys might unduly confuse and influence the voters, which in turn may put into question the credibility of the election. There may be basis for such fears. But the jury is still out there regarding the impact of pre-election surveys on actual voters’ behavior during election day. One study acknowledged the bandwagon effect but qualified the same by describing the effect as prevalent among people who may well have voted for the leading candidate anyway. In truth, the matter on survey impact is a complex one. Election outcomes are still decided by many factors, among them effective campaigning, good timing, and the general sentiment of the populace. Election surveys also do not make projections as to which of the people interviewed are going to vote and how they will vote. That is a vital logistical factor which could influence the outcome of elections. Likewise, anything can happen before election day that may knock the trend off and deliver an ugly surprise to the survey frontrunners. Hillary Clinton, for example, on account of the surveys, was predicted to win against Donald Trump in 2016. The election results surprised many, yet such did not create any major confusion or disruption of electoral democracy. Fortunately, our own Supreme Court holds a more libertarian view when it comes to regulating surveys. It sees the matter as a free speech and press freedom issue. Restricting the conduct and publication of opinion polls during the campaign period amounts to a distrust of the capability of people to decide. McAllister and Studlar (1991) wrote that public opinion polls are too important to be left to politicians and policy makers. In one case, this one about exit polls but which may imply also to pre-election polls, the Supreme Court concluded that “the interest of the state in reducing disruption is outweighed by the drastic abridgment of the constitutionally guaranteed rights of the media and the electorate.” Quite the contrary, according to the Supreme Court, instead of disrupting elections, exit polls --properly conducted and publicized-- can be vital tools for the holding of honest, orderly, peaceful, and credible elections. But then there are fake surveys or surveys improperly conducted. To guard against such kind of surveys, we go back to the questions I earlier asked. Who made the survey? Do they have a credible track record? Who commissioned the survey? What are the sampling methods? What does the survey ask? How were the questions framed? I can say that other than SWS and Pulse Asia, no other local or national survey firm can claim a credible track record. Even SWS and Pulse Asia make room for margin of errors in their survey reports. There are survey outfits managed by those in the academe who do surveys commissioned by local political groups, but the academics behind these surveys make it a point that the results are for internal use only and not to be published. When a local politician starts brandishing survey results from an obscure “survey” firm, a non-commissioned survey at that, it makes you think twice of voting for that politician. The words “non-commissioned survey” already makes it suspect. Even a local survey, to be considered scientifically and statistically sound, is very expensive to execute. So what’s a foundation doing purportedly financing its own survey?"
1,"We are fond of electing candidates based on popularity and personalities and not on policies, issues, achievements, and track records. We even choose politicians in haste without thoroughly assessing their personal and public lives to find their worthiness. It's time we came up with a better set of standards from which we base our decisions. The following poem by Josiah Gilbert Holland may spell the criteria in the worthiness of a candidate and may guide the voters whom to vote for come election day: ""God give us men! A time like this demand Strong minds, great hearts, true faith, and ready hands; Men whom the lust of office does not kill; Men whom the spoils cannot buy; Men who possess opinions and a will; Men who have honored, men who will not lie; Men who can stand before a demagogue And damn his treacherous flatteries without winking! Tall men, sun-crowned, who live above the fog In public duty, and in private thinking; For while the rabble, with their thumb-worn creeds, Their large professions and their little deeds, Mingle in selfish strife, lo! Freedom weeps, Wrong rules the land and waiting Justice sleeps."" The poem aforesaid affords our people the opportunity to judge which of the candidates is worthy and deserving of their precious vote. Our voters can never be swayed by the splendor and beauty of flowery words from glib-tongued politicians who make them adrift with their broken dreams and promises. Never should we succumb to the falsity of some company slogans and political ads of candidates. The coming elections offer so many expectations and we expect better days and times ahead. We expect for a light to appear at the end of the tunnel where we have been groping in the dark for years. We expect our migrant workers to no longer venture in search for greener pasture abroad or elsewhere as a more-fulfilling future with stable and lucrative job opportunities can now be found right here in our own company. We expect the poor and the poorest of our people to be freed from poverty and live happy and prosperous lives. We expect that there will be no more street dwellers, informal settlers, squatters, and those living under bridges, in hovels in crowded slums unfit for habitation. We expect our elected candidates are worthy, hard-working public servants and true leaders not beholden to any master but only to the sovereign people they are committed to serve. All these we expect as we finally expect to get rid of COVID-19 completely as it has been like the Sword of the Damocles hanging over our heads, threatening our very existence. We just hope it will not mutate into other variants and we can live and move safely wherever and whatever we are. Despite the drop in the positivity rate, COVID-19 is still with us. We maybe treading the road to normalcy but we still have to follow minimum health protocols. We still have to wear facemasks which we find inconvenient and a burden. However, there's still a funny side to wearing a face mask as expressed in the following lines from a poem, Summer Rain by Rowena Tiempo Torrevillas, a nationally recognized poet: ""We guess at what the eyes really mean, Above the face masks that have turned us Into burglars or highwaymen in the Wild West Or hostages with mouths duct-taped In our voluntary isolation, we're sneak thieves..."" With COVID-19 completely gone and erased from our lives forever and with worthy hands holding the reins of government we now commence to embark on a journey as one people, one dream towards a common --progress and abundance for all.

1,"This year, I predict that many politicians in Cebu will regret supporting BBM. Those who refuse to heed the lessons of history, or fail to learn from past blunders, are condemned to repeat them. That is not my original line. It comes from George Santayana, a great writer and philosopher. That is a nugget of wisdom too that Cebuano politicians may wish to reflect on and learn from. In 2016, Hilario P. Davide III from the southeast got 616,381 or 47.79% over Gwen's younger brother, Winston F. Garcia from the southwest, who garnered 593,725 or 46.04%. It was a slim lead. It was a much bigger win for Davide in 2013 when he got 614,389 or 56.09% over Gwen's other younger brother, the Bar topnotcher, Pablo John, now deputy speaker, representing the 3rd District, who got 448,826 or 40.98%. Two brothers of Gwen Garcia from Dumanjug and Barili were resoundingly trounced by the son of Chief Justice Hilario Davide Jr., from Argao. Only Gwen is invincible. In 2010, Gwen Garcia from the southwest, won over Hilario Davide III from the southeast. Gwen got 639,587 or 53.5% of the votes over Davide's 543,246 or 45.44%. Gwen Garcia was elected as governor in 2007 but we do not have records of the results. The elections of 2003 was quite controversial but eventually Gwen Garcia was proclaimed winner over Celestino Martinez Jr. with a plurality of less than 10,000 votes. In the 5th District, Gwen's son-in-law Duke Frasco, former mayor of Liloan, shocked the Durano Clan by defeating Red Durano (breaking the 50-year Durano monopoly) with 152,435 (56.61%) convincingly over Durano's 116,826 (43.38%). In the year 2000, Governor Gwen Garcia of Lakas won over Hilario P. Davide, III of the Liberal Party. As mentioned earlier, Garcia garnered 639,587 votes constituting 53.5% while Davide got 543,246 or 45.44%. The rest of the 1,365,975 went to two lesser-known bets Godofredo Benzo who was credited with 7,757 and Rafael Ajoc who got 4,806. That was the year when the Garcias were aligned with president GMA who lorded over the country and controlled all the government resources. She headed the merged Lakas-Kampi-CMD, the merger between Lakas-CMD and Kampi. It was like Marcos' KBL where all the traditional and transactional politicians congregated. In Cebu City, in 2019 the late PDP Laban's Edgar Labella, with 265,738 votes (51.40%) won over LDP's Tomas Osmeña, with 246,813 (47.74%). In 2016, Liberal Party's Tomas Osmeña won over UNA's Mike Rama. Tomas got 266,819 (53.40%) over Mike's 232,925 (46.6%). In 2013, for the first time an Osmeña was defeated. Mike Rama of UNA made history with 215,425 votes (50.70%) defeating Tomas Osmeña narrowly. Tomas got a very respectable 209,497 (49.30%). Mike established a record that broke the once-sacrosanct truism that in Cebu City, no one can beat an Osmeña, As of today, the new truism is that no one is invincible. People are no longer fanatically loyal like the days when Cebuanos were divided between Osmeñistas, Cuencistas, or Duranistas. There is no more ""Bisa'g Unsaon, Osmeña Kami"". Today, we have two kinds of voters: those who follow their principles and those who follow where the money is. There are no more blind followers, or diehard loyalists. Politicians and voters alike should learn, or suffer the karma of regrets and recriminations, all for refusing to discern the patterns of historical truths. Governors and mayors who choose their presidential bets based on expediency and not on merits will soon eat the dust of their miscalculations. The Cebuanos may reelect them but they cannot treat the people of Cebu like mindless herds of unthinking sheep. They still have time to make amends, but the clock is fast ticking, and many political bombs are about to explode."
1,"Politicians often decide to divide constituencies to suit their own agenda. Public interests are never a factor. After May 9, we will have a congressman with only two small towns that are not even contiguous. This is the worst example of gerrymandering. The 6th District was already the smallest in area prior to the separation of Mandaue City. The three LGUs then: Mandaue, Consolacion, and Cordova, which I used to call CoCoMan, had area of only 89.05 square kilometers (smaller than the town of Alegria (89.49 sq.km.), Daanbantayan (92.27 sq.km.), and San Remigio (95.97 sq.km.). The whole 6th District then was way, way smaller than the biggest town of Cebu, Balamban (333 sq.km.). The more congressmen are elected, the more taxes must be collected because this poor nation of too many poor people has to spend at least a billion each for every member of congress each year, even if they only sit there idle or even absent themselves from sessions and committee hearings. When Mandaue was still in the 6th District, it had a total of 61 barangays, and a combined 2015 population of 553,894 and 350,166 voters. Its revenue was ?1.4 billion which is estimated to double given the impact of the Mandanas ruling. It had the best record in terms of a very low poverty incidence of 14.81%, compared to the 32.65% in the 2nd District and the 30.37% poverty in the 7th District. Now that Mandaue is on its own, Consolacion and Cordova are like two orphaned constituencies that will have to pay a congressman and his underlings who shall serve too few people and too small an area. This is the worst case of gerrymandering in Cebu. Undivided, this district used to be represented by Vicente de la Serna (1987-1992, one term), Nerissa Soon Ruiz (1992-1998, two terms), Efren T. Herrera (from Dumanjug who transferred to Lapu-Lapu with his brother priest from 1998-2001, one term). He is now a councilor in the city of Lapu-Lapu. Nerissa Soon Ruiz (2001-2010, three terms), Gabriel Luis Quisumbing (2010-2016, two terms), Jonas C. Cortes (2016-2019, one term), Emmarie M. Oauno Dizon, 2019-2022). Then Mandaue is separated and Dizon is running unopposed. The three constituencies were part of the old 2nd District prior to the 1987 Charter, and were together with Cebu City, Lapu-Lapu, Liloan, and Compostela. And it was then represented by: Sergio Osmeña Sr. (1907-1922, four terms), Vicente Yap Sotto (1922-1925, one term), Paulio A. Gullas (1925-1928, one term), Sotero B. Cabahug (1928-1934, two terms), Hilario Abellana (1934-1941, three terms), Pedro T. Lopez (1945), Vicente Logarta (1946-1949, one term), Leandro A. Tojong (who was dislodged by Vicente Logarta after a protest, 1949-1953), Pedro T. Lopez (1953-57), Sergio Osmeña Jr. (1957-1961), Jose L. Briones (1961-1969, two terms), Sonny Osmeña (1969-1972). Marcos' martial law replaced Congress with a unicameral Batasan Pambansa, with regional representation. Now that Mandaue is out, we have the tiny town of Cordova with an area of 17.15 square kilometers, the smallest town in Cebu, and perhaps in the whole country. Barangay BF Homes in Parañaque City is much bigger in area and population. Barangay Guadalupe in Cebu City is bigger in population. Cordova has a population of 70,595 as of 2020, 39,163 voters. Consolacion has 37.03 square kilometers with 21 barangays and a population of 148,102, and 84,912 voters. The Sitoys are the kingpins of Cordova. The Alegados (nee Pepito) are in control of Consolacion. Since the Lagons of the Ako Bisaya Party list have an alliance with the Alegados, and since there are two Sitoys running, it would seem that Daphne Lagon is likely to win. He will join her husband in Congress if their own party list will garner enough votes for one nominee. If there are enough votes for two, then the incumbent mayor of Consolacion may also be in Congress. The traditional politicians are consolidating their forces. They are the luckiest beneficiaries of the latest gerrymandering. The people have to pay more taxes to fund more congressmen. This is not the way to manage a third-world country. Only the politicians get all the benefits. The people bear more and more burdens. The poor are always the pawns while the elite get all the glory, the power, and the money. That is the prize we always pay for what we call a false democracy. Shame on the trapos and shame on us too for allowing this to happen."
1,"Kasabihan nang walang bayaning tinanggap sa kanyang sariling bayan. Sa ibang lugar ay puwede siyang dakilain, pero sa mismong pinagmulan niya ay hindi, dahil kilalang-kilala na siya mula ulo hanggang paa. Ganu’n mismo ang nagaganap ngayon sa isang sikat na pulitiko, maraming political ads na nagpapalutang sa kagandahan ng kanyang puso sa pagtulong sa ating mga kababayan, pero hindi ‘yun pinaniniwalaan sa probinisyang kinalakihan niya. Unang komento ng aming source, “Talagang hindi! Pinagtataasan nila ng kilay ang mga political ads ng kababayan nila, pinagtatawanan pa nga! “Huwag daw tayong maniniwala sa mga pinagsasasabi niya, hindi raw totoo ‘yun, hindi raw siya karapat-dapat iluklok sa mataas na posisyon!” unang hirit ng aming impormante. Maraming kababayan ng kilalang pulitiko ang hanggang ngayo’y may kani-kanyang kuwentong kipkip sa kanilang kalooban. Sariwa pa sa kanilang alaala ang mga malulungkot na istoryang ‘yun. Sabi uli ng aming source, “Hindi siguro niya akalaing papasok siya sa ganito katinding laban! Hindi niya siguro naisip na marami siyang tinanggihang tulungan sa mismong lugar niya! “Lalo na ngayong panahon na ng kampanya, buhay na buhay ang kanilang mga kuwento tungkol sa sikat na politician! May mga nagpupunta pala sa bahay niya nu’n para humingi ng tulong na hindi man lang niya pinagbubuksan! “Matagal nang nakabilad sa initan ang mga kababayan natin, pero walang nagbubukas ng gate, samantalang nasa bahay naman siya! Maraming beses na nangyari ‘yun, deadma lang siya, kaya maraming hindi naniniwala sa laman ng political ads niya! “Tapos ngayon, dahil lumalaban nga siya, e, ang dami-dami niyang binibitiwang pangako! Nasa puso daw niya ang pagtulong, maaasahan daw siya ng mga Pinoy, kaya siya ang karapat-dapat regaluhan ng boto ng mga kababayan natin! “Ganu’n? Daang milyon ang pinangangakuan niya ngayon, samantalang ‘yung mga kababayan niyang humihingi ng tulong sa kanya nu’n, e, hindi niya naman pinapansin! “Deadma lang siya, hindi man lang sabihan ang mga boy at kasambahay nila na papasukin ang nagmamakaawa ng ayuda! ‘Yun ba ang nangangako pang ipagpapatayo ng bahay ang mga Pilipinong walang tirahan? “Naku, hindi lang niya maamin kahit ng mga alipores niya, sinisira kaya ang mga posters niya sa mismong lugar nila? Pinupunit ‘yun, dahil walang naniniwala sa mga ipinapangako niya!” inis na pagtatapos ng aming source. Ubos! Nadale na naman si Kim Chiu ng kanyang mga bashers dahil sa kanyang post na napuyat daw siya sa panonood ng giyerang nagaganap sa pagitan ng Russia at Ukraine. Ang ganda pa naman sana ng sinabi niya, mulat siya sa mga nagaganap sa mundo, hindi basta pag-aartista lang ang tinututukan niya. Pero sumablay si Kim, sa Tiktok pala siya nanonood, hindi sa mga news programs na tulad ng CNN, BBC at iba pang nangungunang news network. Du’n siya pinutakti ng pamba-bash, bakit daw Tiktok ang pinanonood niya? Alam daw naman niyang maraming fake news sa Tiktok? Mayaman daw naman siya, wala na siyamg intermet, para magkaroon siya ng tamang source ng balita? Maraming nam-bash kay Kim na nagsabing nagpapaka-profound kasi siya, nagkukunwaring malalim at matalino, samantalang mababaw lang naman talaga siya. Nakakaawa naman si Kim. Pero kung mga tamang programa ang kanyang tinututukan tungkol sa giyera sa pagitan ng Russia at Ukraine ay malalaman niya na pananakop ang dahilan ng digmaang ito. At kulang sa puwersa ang Ukraine dahil ang pangako ng Amerika at NATO na pagsaklolo sa Ukraine ay wala pa hanggang ngayon kaya ang mga sundalo lamang ng Ukraine ang lumalaban. At malalaman din ni Kim na ang tunay na depensa ng maliliit na bansa ay ang kanilang mga sariling sundalo lang at hindi makakaasa sa pangako ng mga dayuhan. At lalong matatakot si Kim kapag gumalaw na ang China sa pananakop sa ating bayan. Dedepensa nang solohan ang ating mga sundalong kulang na kulang habang naghihintay ng suporta sa NATO at iba pang kaalyadong bansa. Walang nagagawang mabuti ang digmaan, lahat ng aspeto ay nawawasak, milyon ang mamamatay. Ang mga bata ang pinakakawawang nilalang kapag may giyera, ang mga musmos na walang alam, habang pinapatay at namamatay ang kanilang mga magulang sa mismong harapan nila. Ang mga kababayan nating nagtatrabaho sa Ukraine ay inilikas na ng ating pamahalaan sa Poland, may ilan-ilan nang nakauwi, habang nakahanda na ring lumikas ang mga maraming OFW na nandu’n pa. Harinawang matapos na ang giyerang ito, may mamagitan sanang mga lider ng bansa na tapusin na ang giriang ito, bago pa lumawak ang labanan na siguradong damay rin tayo dahil sa pagtaas ng presyo ng gasolina at bakal na sa kanila nanggagaling."
1,"If there is a region that could give BBM's so-called Solid North a run for their money, it is the three Visayan regions, especially Region 7. Let us discuss figures, not speculations. Central Visayas is the cradle of Christianity in the Far East. It is also the site of the first battle, where a native from Mactan, Lapu-Lapu, was able to subdue a Western colonizer, Fernando Magallanes, and kill him, the first of such a feat in the entire Asia against a European. Visayans are religious but deeply patriotic, and are not afraid to kill to defend honor and dignity. In politics too, Visayans take their politics very seriously. This region is also the site of the first treaty between the east and the west through the Blood Compact between Miguel Lopez de Legazpi and Rajah Sikatuna. And the place where the longest revolt by Francisco Dagohoy was staged in Bohol from 1744 to 1829, or for a period of 86 years. It was in Cebu where the late Nene Pimentel founded the PDP or Partidong Demokratiko Pilipino on February 6, 1982. It merged with Ninoy Aquino's Laban in the 1986 snap elections to fight the dictatorship of Marcos. It was also here in Central Visayas where Pusyon Bisaya was born in 1978, the only party that defeated Marcos' behemoth KBL. Thus, other Filipinos should take note that this region is traditionally an opposition bailiwick, the home of non-conformists and dissenters. In 2016, in Cebu, the multi-billionaire Bongbong Marcos only got 307,676 while Leni, unknown, unfunded, and not endorsed by the governor garnered 807,922. Robredo was ahead of Marcos by 500,246. Since the overall final vote standing between the two was Robredo’s 14,418,817 over BBM's 14,155,344 or a difference of 263,473, it can be said that it was the Cebuano votes that made VP Leni win over Marcos. If she was able to achieve that feat when she was not the incumbent, with more reason today that she is the sitting vice president with an excellent record of performance, and Bongbong has no position. Leni, whether endorsed by the governor and the mayor or not, is strong on her own. The people normally exercise their independent judgment when it comes to the presidency. It was Cayetano who was endorsed by the LGUs due to the urging of President Digong. In Bohol, Marcos got only 79,724 while Leni had 273,589 or a difference of 193,865. Bongbong was a distant third, Leni was first and Alan Peter Cayetano was second with 169,247. Marcos was rejected by the majority of Boholanos. If he was rejected before, why would he be chosen this time? He was not helping the victims of Odette in Bohol. He was not helping at all in past disasters that devastated many of the century-old churches of this deeply-religious province. In Siquijor, with about 50,000 total votes, Leni Robredo garnered 30,468. Cayetano was second with 7,291. Marcos was third again with a measly 5,746 votes or one sixth of Robredo's votes. In Negros Oriental, Leni Robredo got 254,207 votes, over Cayetano's 100,256. Marcos only got a small 66,255 votes or less than one fourth of Leni's votes. It is therefore clear that in 2016, when Leni was an unknown provinciana from Naga, Cam Sur, she topped the vice presidential contests in all the four provinces of Cebu, Bohol, Siquijor, and Negros Oriental. If we add the votes of Leni in all four provinces of Central Visayas: 807,922 (Cebu), 273,589 (Bohol), 30,468 (Siquijor), and 254,207 (Negros Oriental), that would be a 1,366,194. Compared that to Marcos' poor showing of 307,676 (Cebu), 79,724 (Bohol), 5,746 (Siquijor), and 66,255 (Negros Oriental) or a mere sum of 459,401. Therefore, Leni won over Marcos by no less than 459,401 here in Central Visayas alone. Now, tell me, how in the world will Marcos be able to reverse that? Money? Maneuvers? Hello, Garci? The Visayans won't allow any such shenanigans. No one can deny the numbers. They are official facts and figures. Let the trolls argue against the numbers. To them I dare say: ""Contra factum non valet argumentum"" Let them figure that out too. There are many people who say that they hate me and also hate my columns but they keep on reading them. Let them elevate their arguments over and above the ""ad hominem"" and ""ad absurdum"". Time for trolls to start accepting defeat. They will soon eat the dust."
1,"CEBU, Philippines —  With campaigns getting more intense by the day, the police urged supporters not to make their political choices drive violence. ""Dili lang nato ibutang nga musangkot ta sa panaglalis, sa physical nga butang, aron lang pagpakita sa suporta nato... kung duna man gani tay gi-suportahan, not to the point nga makapasakit ta or makalapas sa balaod,"" said Lt. Col. Wilbert Parilla, deputy director for operations of the Cebu City Police Office. Parilla made the call after supporters of presidential candidate Leni Robredo filed a complaint with the police against an official of the Sangguniang Kabataan in Cebu Province who allegedly harassed them at a bar in Barangay Mabolo, Cebu City dawn. The group alleged the SK official hurt two members physically after telling them that they were joining a non-partisan gathering. They said the bar was not exclusive to a group at that time. They went there to have fun after attending Robredo’s campaign rally on Thursday, February 24, 2022. ""Naay nagpa-blotter, they arrived sa isa ka imnanan diha sa Banilad and then they are wearing a political color, then, suddenly, according sa complainant, giduol sya and then giingnan nga 'this is a non-partisan party',” Parilla said. Quoting the blotter at the Mabolo Police Station, the complainants said they told the SK official that they only went to the bar to have fun but the conversation escalated quickly. ""Mao to nga allegedly gi-liab sya sa suspect,"" Parilla said. The official allegedly pulled the shirts of two group members, ripping one in the process. The necklace of one of the two was also broken. The SK official also allegedly pushed one of the two members off a high chair. The Freeman is withholding the names of the parties involved pending comment from the SK official. No comment has been issued as of this writing. Parilla said they are waiting for the complainant’s decision to file formal charges or not. An investigator is also looking into the complaint if it merits filing of charges in court or if the conflict can be settled at the barangay level. ""Tan-awon pa sa imbestigador kung direkta na ba nato i-file ang kaso or ato rang i-refer sa barangay... if, in case, it is only a minor offense sa assessment sa imbestigador, iagi pa sa barangay,"" Parilla said. – JMO (FREEMAN)"
1,"“The more the merrier.” Iyan ang lumang kasabihan sa politika. Habang nadaragdagan ang mga sumusuporta sa isang kandidato, dapat masaya niyang tanggapin ito. Hindi kasi puwedeng pigilan ang sino mang grupo ng mga tao sa pagpili ng gusto nilang tambalan sa pagka-presidente at bise presidente. Naging kontrobersyal si presidential aspirant at Manila Mayor Isko Moreno nang mag-viral sa social media ang larawan niya sa isang rally ng mga taong nagsusulong ng tambalang “Isko-Sara.” Katakut-takot na batikos ang ibi­nato kay Isko dahil lumalabas na inilaglag niya ang kanyang opisyal na katambal sa pagka-bise presidente na si Dr. Willie Ong. Kung ako si Doc Willie, magdaramdam ako siyempre. Maaaring tahimik lang siya pero malamang, sa loob-loob niya ay mayroon siyang hinanakit. Pagod din sa panga­ngampanya si Doc Willie at wala siyang presidential aspirant na itinataguyod bukod sa official partner niya na si Isko. Kasi nga naman ay dumalo pa si Isko sa naturang rally at sa sasakyang kinalululanan niya ay nakapaskel ang mag­katabing retrato nila ni Sara. Para kay Sara, bagamat pina­sasalamatan niya ang nagtataguyod sa tambalan nila ni Isko, si Bongbong Marcos ang opisyal niyang katambal at kandidato sa pagka-presidente. Sa tingin ko, labag sa ethical standard ng isang pulitikong may opisyal na kapareha na makipag-partner sa iba kaya may katwiran ang mga tumutuligsa sa kanyang ginawa. Nagpahayag naman si Isko na hindi niya inilalaglag si Doc Willie at sila lang dalawa hanggang sa huli. Pero sa tingin ko, the damage is done. Iyan na ang nabuong impresyon sa mata ng taumbayan. Hindi bale kung hindi na lang siya dumalo sa imbitasyon ng mga nagsusulong ng Isko-Sara tandem, madaling unawain iyon. Ngunit lumilitaw, batay sa mga nag-viral na larawan na si Isko ay namangka sa dalawang ilog. Sayang naman. Batay sa mga nagdaang presidential interview, dalawa lang siyang mahusay sumagot sa mga tanong bagamat hindi pa personal na nagkakaharap: siya lang at si Bongbong."
1,"The perennial rivalry between the Salimbangons and the Martinezes in the 4th District of Cebu can be compared only to Cebu's historical rivalries between the Osmeñas and the Cuencos in the earlier years, and later, when the Osmeñas and Cuenco forces fused, the fights between Osmeña-Cuenco fusion on one side versus Durano and allies on the other side. They are oil and water, yin and yang, Montagues and Capulets. What matters most to us, however, is this: What have they done for the people? The Martinezes used to control the 4th District, until the late Benhur Salimbangon disrupted the Martinez monopoly. The 4th District is composed of one component city (Bogo), and eight municipalities: Bantayan, Daanbantayan, Madridejos, Medellin, San Remigio, Santa Fe, Tabogon, and Tabuelan. It has a total land area of 484.19 square kilometers, about half of the size of the 5th District and one third of the area of the 3rd District. Its 2015 population was 427,641 (must be nearing 500,000 by now) and 282,172 voters (must be 200,000 today). The 4th District has 144 barangays and an annual revenue of ?1.1 billion (must be ?2 billion now under the Mandanas ruling). But its poverty incidence is 27.60% and its per capita income is only ?2,788 which is the second to the lowest among the seven districts. The leaders should do something to alleviate the poverty among the common people, as more than one-fourth of the population live below the poverty line. After the 1987 Constitution, the representatives were Celestino E. Martinez Jr. (1987-98, three terms) and Clavel A. Martinez (1998-2007, three terms). In 2007, Benhur Salimbangon was proclaimed winner but his victory was belatedly annulled on January 11, 2010. Benhur however won in 2010 and served three terms until 2019. His wife won in 2019 and is now running for reelection. Before 1987, today's 4th District (together with Balamban, Tuburan, and Asturias) used to be the old 7th district, and was represented in Congress by the following: Pedro L. Rodriguez (1907-09, one term), Eulalio E. Causing (1909-1912, one term), Tomas N. Alonso (1912-1919, two terms), Jose N. Alonso (1919-1925, two terms), Paulino Ybañez (1925-1934, three terms), Buenaventura P. Rodriguez (1934-38, two terms), Roque V. Desquitado, (1938-1941, one term), Jose V. Rodriguez (1945-1949, one and a half terms), Nicolas G. Escario (1949-1957, two terms), Antonio de Pio (1957-1961, one term), Tereso Dumon (1961-1969, two terms) and Celestino Sybico Jr. (1969-1972). During martial law the Lower House was replaced by a unicameral Batasan Pambansa with regional representation. Bogo is the bailiwick of the Martinezes but they are now being challenged by the Salimbangons in their own turf. On June 16, 2007, 97.82% of its voters supported the cityhood of Bogo. It then became the sixth component city in the Province of Cebu, aside from Danao, Toledo, Talisay, Naga, and Carcar. Bogo has a population of 88,867 with 53,235 voters. If 90% of the voters here would support Martinez, Salimbangon will have a big headache. Bogo has a revenue of more than ?641 million and total assets of ?1.56 billion and counting considering the impact of the Mandanas ruling. Its poverty incidence at 18.62% is much lower than the district's 27.60%. Bogo is better managed than the whole district. NUP's Daphne Salimbangon, daughter of Representative Janice, is challenging PPP's Carlo Jose Martinez, the incumbent, for city mayor. The incumbent vice mayor, Maria Cielo A. Martinez of PPP is also being opposed by Laurel Almirante of NUP. These are exciting fights worth watching. I remember the famous rivalry between the Dimaporos and the Quibranzas in Lanao in the 50’s and 60’s. It was stopped when Abdullah Dimaporo married Imelda Quibranza. Love is the antidote to politics. I doubt if this will apply to the Salimbangons and the Martinezes. Whoever wins, they should remind themselves that this is not about the politicians. This is about the people. Let them ponder on that."
1,"There should be a law that should prohibit political surveys, or, at the very least, regulate this apparently rewarding business of certain groups of enterprising geniuses in the marketing industry. They only create some mind-conditioning trends that favor certain candidates, many of whom are the very ones funding these activities, and most of whom are really the more deserving aspirants for high political offices. It is our considered view that the conduct of political surveys creates more harm than good in the electoral system of our country. It does not contribute to the improvement of the quality of political decision-making and can only exacerbate the evils of the peoples' bandwagon mentality. Such surveys also add more problems to the notorious propensity endemic among the less informed ""hoi polloi"", to just go along with the directions of the crowd, regardless of merits and fitness. That is precisely the reason why less-qualified candidates appear to be lording it over the more deserving. There is no transparency on who initiated the conduct of these polls, nor is there any attempt to inform the public of how these are done and by whom. Who knows if these activities are being funded by moneyed trapos and the manner of executing them are being twisted and turned to favor the sponsors and financiers? There is no openness on what were the questions asked and in what manner they were framed and propounded. There is no assurance either that those who were entrusted with the crucial tasks of gathering the results were independent professionals, and not paid lackeys and underlings of highly-partisan groups. It is also statistically improbable that asking two or three thousand people would generate a fair and reasonable sampling that would objectively reflect the thinking and sentiments of 68 million registered voters. There is no disclosure on how the sample respondents were chosen across many socio-economic strata and among the 17 geographic regions in the whole archipelago of 7,107 islands, peopled by 111 million inhabitants. There is no transparency on who is behind the conduct of these notorious activities. And yet, the results do impact on the changing landscapes of the national pulse. These surveys are insidious means to condition the minds of the electorate and are apparently designed to sway those whose decisions can easily be manipulated. These activities do not have an apparent, much less real, socially-redeeming value. They do not contribute positively to the objective formation of national consensus. They create information and data whose sources are unclear and even suspicious. They use the power of information to promote the agenda of persons and groups that contribute heavily to their financial and material gains. The Commission on Elections is focusing on confiscating and removing posters that do not conform to their arbitrary determinations of what is fair and square campaigning. These are the trivialities and peripheral matters. They ignore however, the more compelling and the more far-reaching evils, shown by the tremendous damage that political surveys are inflicting on the national psyche. It is high time that the people themselves should stand up and unmask these new conspiracies and direct assaults against the need to elevate the quality of our political decision-making."
1,"Why are political dynasties too driven in their greed for power? Let us call a spade a spade. Let's discuss democracy not from its legal and political perspectives but from the behavioral and psychological sense. From the little that I know of human behavior, political dynasties are manifestations of some peoples' consuming fear of powerlessness. They are driven by an unstoppable craving to be in control. Dynasties, therefore, are their defense mechanisms. Members of these dynasties are a bunch of insecure people. They are so afraid that they shall lose their wealth, power, influence, and prestige if and when they are not in control. This culture of greed for power can be traced back to the olden times of tribes and clans. Those who own a piece of land or territory have to make sure that they control decision making in the allocations of resources and tools. Thus the village chief controls all the allocation of resources and powers. He named his subalterns and underlings who are entrusted to control smaller areas and lesser numbers of timawas, aliping saguiguilid and aliping namamahay. The datus and the rajahs were the first proponents of political dynasties. When the Spaniards came, they introduced the encomienda system and marginalized the datus and the rajahs who had to move to the forests and start the new settlements and villages. The encomiendas led to the emergence of haciendas owned by the hacienderos and hacienderas, the dons and the doñas who were called señores and señoras by their peasant workers and muchachas and muchachos. The insulares and peninsulares were the lords and masters of the haciendas. To protect their possessions, they had to be on top of the pueblos and became the gobernadorcillos, like Capitan Tiago in Rizal's “Noli Me Tangere”. They were the heads of the new political dynasties. The leaders of the Philippine revolution were mostly ilustrados who owned landed estates like Emilio Aguinaldo who became the first Philippine president. He was a strong advocate of political dynasties. Although the family of Dr. Jose Rizal in Calamba, Laguna, were not encomenderos, they were leasing the land of the Dominican friars and because of their political connections, they were not really identified with the peasantry, and thus giving aid and comfort to the ruling class led by the friars and the encomenderos. Rizal himself, like Antonio and Juan Luna, Marcelo del Pilar, and many leaders of the revolution were ilustrados. Only Andres Bonifacio was ""anak pawis"" and came from the working class. When the Americans came, they trained Manuel L. Quezon, Sergio Osmeña, Manuel Roxas, and Jose P. Laurel, who all belonged to the ruling class of landed clans and families. These were the people who were afraid that if they were not in politics, whatever possessions their families had might be taken from them. Political dynasties therefore arose out of fear to lose power, prestige, wealth and influence. Until today, you can look at the profiles of today’s dynasties, from Ilocos to Moroland, the ones who control economic power are also in control of political powers. It can thus be concluded that political dynasties are defensive mechanisms. They are fortifications against enemy attacks. They are defensive walls protecting the powerful from rival tribes who might launch an offensive warfare in order to grab possessions and people. There are political dynasties because the rich, the powerful and the famous elite are constantly gripped by an overwhelming fear of losing control."
1,"This is the district that produced Cebu's first governor, Julio Aballe Llorente and Cebu's first and only chief justice, Hilario Gelbolingo Davide Jr., from Colawin, Argao. Cebu's second legislative district is what I call ADABOSS, my own mnemonic for Argao, Dalaguete, Alcoy, Boljoon, Oslob, Santander, and Samboan. This is a combination of the old 4th District minus Sibonga (before the 1987 Constitution) then controlled by the Kintanars of Argao and one-half of the old 5th District, then controlled by the Cuencos, and later by the Calderons. It is special to me because I was born in Argao. After the Constitution of 1987, the old 2nd District included what is now 7th District, which I call DRAMMBAG for Dumanjug, Ronda, Alcantara, Moalboal, Malabuyoc, Badian, Alegria, and Ginatilan. It also included the ADABOSS, as enumerated above. It was the entire southern Cebu but the Garcias then led by Dumanjug's Pablo Garcia and Willy Caminero, supported by their allies, split the geographic paramecium and made it two districts. I used to call it ""Garciameandering"" or ""Caminerondering"" but Governor Gwen reasoned out that the intent is to hasten the development of the areas. Undivided, it comprised the old 4th District minus Sibonga, the entire old 5th District, from Boljoon to Alcantara, and two towns from the old 6th District, Ronda and Dumanjug. Today, the ADABOSS is the second smallest district (next to the tiny 6th District) in area and in population (the second lowest next to the 7th District). It is only 395.21 square kilometers, slightly bigger the single town of Balamban (333 sq. km.), but with seven towns, 143 barangays, a 2015 population of 239,820 (must be more than 260,000 by now) and 161,417 voters (can be 180,000 to 200,000 by now). It has the second lowest revenue of 761,000,455 annually, a poverty incidence of 32.65% and a per capita income of 3,663. It suffers in comparison to other districts in Cebu, except only the 7th District. Today's congressman is Willy S. Caminero, who is term-limited and is now running to regain his old post as Argao mayor. The undivided 2nd District used to be represented by muro ami fishing magnate Sol Abines (1987-1998, three terms), Simeon L. Kintanar (1998-2007, three terms), Pablo P. Garcia (2007-2013, two terms), and Willy S. Caminero (2013-2022, three terms). No matter what they say, the second and the seventh districts are the least developed and are remembered only during disasters and elections. The people are poor but the politicians are very rich. In fact, the two contenders for congressman this year are both multi-millionaires. How can we truly say, there is only One Cebu? The old 5th District, from Boljoon of the east to Alcantara of the west (prior to the 1987 Charter) had representatives Troadio D. Galicano (1907-1912, two terms), Mariano Jesus D. Cuenco (1912-1928, five terms as there were no term limits before), Tomas N. Alonso (1928-31, one term), Miguel Cuenco (1931-1945, five terms), Leandro A. Tojong (1946-1949, one term), Miguel D. Cuenco (1949-1965, four terms), Antonio V. Cuenco (1965-69, one term), Emerito S. Calderon (father of today's 7th District Rep. Peter John Calderon), from 1969 until martial law, 1972. Marcos abolished the Lower House and had a regional Batasan Pambansa. The old 4th District called SAAD (Sibonga, Argao, Alcoy, and Dalaguete) had representatives Alejandro Ruiz (1907-1919, three terms), Isidoro Aldanese (1919-1925, two terms), Juan F. Alcazaren (1925-1934, three terms), Agustin Kintanar (1934-35, one term, shortened by the 1935 Constitutional Convention), Vicente Rama (1935-38, one term), Agustin Y. Kintanar (1938-1949, three terms), Filomeno C. Kintanar (1949-1953, one term), Isidro C. Kintanar (1953-1969, four terms), and Gaudencio Beduya (1969-1972, one term). The 2nd District has tremendous potential for mining (oil in Alegria and coal in Argao) and tourism (Argao, Oslob, Badian, Moalboal) and agriculture as well as fishing. Its leaders must have enough vision and dynamism, competence and drive. I hope Tata Salvador or Edsel Galeos (may the best one win) is one such leader. A glorious past should be matched with a shining future."
1,"Do these guys really know the meaning of love for our country? My thesis is that they only love themselves, their own families, and their own interests. I dare say, and I am waiting for any reaction to this very provocative accusation, that politicians are the most unloving people in the whole of Christendom. And the unkindest cut of all is that they disguise their unloving nature by all forms of masquerades and pretensions. Hypocrisy, self-righteousness and condescension; these are the worst indications of their unloving nature. My criterion is no less than St. Paul's definition of love in First Corinthians, chapter 13: ""Love is patient, love is kind, it does not boast, it is not proud or haughty. Love is not rude, it is not self-seeking. It is not easily provoked or angered, love does not delight in evil but rejoices in the truth"". The evidence against politicians, pointing to their unloving nature are plenty; greed for power by monopolizing all public positions, or a family dynasty. Any politician who wants to debate on this proposition: Resolved that family dynasties violate the law of love. Any politician who wants to take the negative side? Love is not just the romantic kind. Even Shakespeare wrote in A Midsummer Night's Dream: ""Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind"". For politicians, the first proof of love is to think hard about being a candidate for a position that one does not know anything about. Love is not to rush into running for some exalted position, like that of a congressman or senator, if one does not know the nuances and the intricacies of laws and lawmaking. Just because you are popular and you have money, does not mean that you can be an effective public servant. Winning in an election is not acceptable proof that one is qualified. Running without being qualified is the greatest antithesis to love. Politicians do not know how to love because they do not think first about what to promise before opening their mouth. Most of them do not have bona fide intentions to serve. They want the money, the glory and the power. We are lucky if we find one among a thousand candidates who is truly prepared with an honest-to-goodness platform of government, with specific goals, broken down into action steps, with defined timetables and a clear and sure source of funding support. Politicians do not know how to love because they are liars. They lie about their SALN, hiding assets and refusing to disclose the true sources of their income. Most politicians are impatient, lacking in consideration for others' limitations. They are unkind, unforgiving, and lacking in concern. Whenever they give and whenever they share, there are always many strings attached. They exploit the ignorance and poverty of others. They are lacking in sincere empathy and genuine compassion. Their giving of ayuda is just for show. Most of what they give was donated by supporters. They always have a camera documenting their good deeds. Politicians are haughty and arrogant, self-centered, and excessively proud. If there is one politician who completely follows St. Paul's definition of love, I will take back everything I say here and I shall retract all my condemnations of politicians. I challenge you to send in the clown and I will retire from writing columns."
1,"This year’s national and local political exercise is both unique and notable for two reasons. One, it is happening during a pandemic. Two, one major political group seems to have figured out already how to win the election while its opponents are playing catch-up, yet still are clueless on how to do it. Let me tackle the clueless part. I’ve been in touch with a friend who is active in the campaign in Cebu for an opposition presidential candidate. I told him last November that the coming elections will be won in a major part through the use of data. My sense comes from serving as consultant and lawyer in four election cycles these past 10 or so years, which does not make me an expert; but it somehow gave me a first-hand view of the inner workings of our electoral exercise. The May 9, 2022 election will be in favor of those who have set their sails in a direction toward data-driven campaigning. I don’t pretend to know the specifics of how it can be done, but I’m confident enough to advise my friend to make sure the campaign team that he is helping stays on course along this line. The other day I asked him how the campaign is doing. I asked the question with already a clue of what his answer might be. “It’s not working for a number of reasons,” he said, “for one, it’s a pissing contest.” He was lamenting about the know-it-all members of the team. “Daghan kaayong magpataas sa ihi. Maybe I’ll just have to do the campaigning on my own, within the communities where I have influence,” he said. I told him not to get discouraged. There are still over 80 days before the end of the election campaign period. Many lessons can still be learned, sails can still be adjusted to catch the best wind. How? That is a difficult question, one that can be answered not by mere assumptions but by actual data on the ground. For sure, it could not be as simplistic as pointing to data alone as a determinant of political success. But data can play a decisive role in the targeting of political campaigns. In the hands of authoritarian leaders and those without moral scruples, data can be easily obtained and used through nefarious methods in order to influence voters. Data-driven strategies are not new in political campaigning. Socio-demographic surveys had for decades provided political operators with information about the voters they intend to woo. In the past, it was in the form of knocking on doors, seeking to identify and interviewing possible supporters. In today’s information technology ecosystem, data about voters --their socio-demographic situation as well as their sentiments, attitudes, and preferences-- are well within the reach of chief architects of social media-driven information and disinformation campaigns. The more unscrupulous the campaign operators are, the more advantage they gain against their opponents. Aided by a foreign power or entity, these local operators would have no qualms stealing data unwittingly yielded by users of information technology to the social media platforms, and then using these data to predict with reasonable confidence what people are predisposed to believe without much question, and where people can be more vulnerable to precise messaging. (Check your mobile phone’s privacy settings. Most likely it’s set at default to allow social media and other online apps to monitor your online behavior, as well as track your interests and physical movements.) In my next column article, I’ll discuss what communication experts say about data profiling, including its limits, and on keeping a close watch of on-the-ground realities, which is very important in an election campaign."
1,"CEBU, Philippines — The church should not endorse a particular candidate and priests should remain non-partisan, said Cebu Archbishop Jose Palma. But the archbishop encouraged the lay people to be actively involved in the upcoming national and local elections in May. “As a general rule, we always say, the church people—bishops, priests, should be non-partisan,” said Palma. With this, priests are not allowed to endorse a candidate nor the church itself, Palma stressed. “As a bishop, as a church leader, I for one, should say, do not use the church to endorse a particular candidate,” added Palma. The lay people, however, should be involved in the elections, Palma said. “Lay people should feel involved. The Pope would use—should meddle in politics, they should campaign for those they believe bring/deliver for the good of the country..but we use the word responsible voting discernment,” added Palma. Along with this, Palma said, the Catholic Bishop Conference of the Philippines(CBCP) is coming up with guidelines in form of a pastoral letter that will serve as a guide for both candidates and voters in the upcoming election. “We are coming out, I mean the  CBCP, a pastoral letter, which is a good guidance for both the candidates and the voters,“ Palma said. “The document is in our hands. We are in the process of meeting together, fine tuning it and eventually coming out with guidelines. The idea is responsible voting and active involvement especially of the lay people,” added Palma. Palma said there is a need to study many aspects of candidates’ life, from personal/track record  to his capacity and programs undertaken. — Decemay Padilla, KQD (FREEMAN)"
1,"Geniuses are polluting the airlines with trash. The advertising industry employs a number of geniuses whose creative ads generate billions in sales, from food products to beers, from consumer items to tourism sites. But in the field of political advertisement, they seem to be 'babes in the wood."" Their works are sophomoric and are disgusting to the taste of the thinking and discerning voters. I think that they have a social obligation to elevate the quality of their outputs and treat the voters with respect. Today's ads must have been crafted based on the premise that Filipino voters are shallow-minded. They better think again. If they know their craft they should realize that more than one third of the 68 million registered voters are between the ages of 18 and 30. These guys are educated, well-informed and are discriminating enough to see which ads are outright trash and which are works of decent and respectful professionals in the advertising industry. They should change their premises and proceed from an awareness that their target audience are not morons or imbeciles. For instance, here is a party list that claims that they are the ones who gave more aid during disasters and calamities. That begs the question: is it the task of party list legislators to grab the work of the DSWD and the disaster reliefs and rehabilitation instrumentalities of the government ? Why did that party not enact legislation to improve the quality of the government's responses to disasters and calamities?  Then, here is a former senator, who is a half-brother of another former member of the senate (they both lost in 2019) whose ads says that he is the good one, the pure and the spotless. It begs the question: Is he saying that his half- brother is the bad one? Well, he may be right, but such an ad leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Another political ad is claiming that when the candidate won as mayor, the city was in shambles, dirty, disorderly, with too many addicts and the city government was totally inept, negligent and uncaring. In a matter of months, he made it a model city and clean it up from garbage and graft. My God. Did this braggart realize that he was attacking himself because he was the vice mayor of that city and he belonged to the party of the former local executives that he was attacking. He wants to shine at the expense of retired and dead trapos whom he used to worship as his mentors.  Such a gall to mislead the voters. This guy is critical of the current administration. He should remember that he was an undersecretary under that administration. Are his ad makers doing research? Then a presidential bet has the gall to call for unity, for all Filipinos to rise together as one. He claims that he has the moral authority to lead the whole nation to its renaissance. This is the guy who declares that he will never allow the press, much less the public, to see his SALN. This is the one who was found guilty of not filing his income tax return, not once, not twice but for more times. This is the one who refuses to face Jessica Soho in a fair and square interview by a very professional and much respected career journalist. After the nation was in shambles after his family's 21 years rule, he now claims to be the new messiah? My Lord, and my God. Well, at the end of the day, I do not blame these traditional politicians for they are really used to this kind of chicanery. I am blaming the ad makers, and I am calling on them to have some decency and a little respect for the Filipino electorate. I know that they are paid millions by the candidates. They are not selling ""bagoong"" or ""patis"" They are selling ideas and future presidents. Thus, with more reason that they should improve their craft. They either shape up or ship out."
1,"MANGILAN-NGILAN na lang ang pelikula sa ngayong panahon ng pandemya kaya hindi kataka-taka kung magsusumiksik sa pulitika ang “laos” na aktor para kumita. Tumakbo na ang aktor bilang vice governor ng isang probinsiya at vice mayor ng isang siyudad sa Metro Manila ng nakalipas na mga election subalit hindi naniniwala ang mga botante sa kakayahan niya. ‘Ika nga, wala naman kasi siyang inilalahad na plataporma. Sa darating na May election, sasabak na muli sa puli­tika si aktor at nominee siya sa isang party-list. Kung magkasunod na semplang ang inabot niya sa nakaraang elections, dito kaya sa party-list niya magogoyo ang mga botante? Naloko na! Hak hak hak! Sa panahon ng hi-tech­ na gadgets mahihirapang makaahon sa kumunoy ang aktor, ‘di ba mga kosa? Mismooooo! Dipugaaaaa! Kailangan pa bang i-memorize ‘yan? Kung sabagay, wala namang maipagmalaki na accomplishment ang aktor para iakyat siya sa Kongreso. Puro kahihiyan nga ang pinasok niya. Alam naman ng mga kosa ko sa pelikula na inanakan ni aktor ang isang aktres na galing sa sikat na pamilya. Subalit lumaki na ang bata ay ni isang kusing wala naman siyang iniabot na sustento. Ano ba ‘yan? Lumalabas tuloy na walang malasakit si aktor sa kanyang pamilya. Kung hindi maayos ni aktor ang takbo ng buhay niya paano natin maasahan na magkakaroon siya ng malasakit sa mga botanteng Pinoy o sa bansa? Araguuyyyyy! Nagkaroon din ang aktor ng mayaman na ka-live-in subalit nauwi sa kasuhan dahil sa pera. Hak hak hak! Lolokohin lang ni aktor ang kapwa n’ya mga Pinoy? Ano sa tingin n’yo mga kosa? Dipugaaaaa! Sa totoo lang, matagal nang walang movie at television projects si aktor kaya’t minabuti niyang bumalik sa pulitika at baka makaloko pa siya. Sa pagkaalam ng mga kosa ko, wala namang ginawa sa buhay si aktor kundi magdudumikit sa mga maimpluwensiyang pulitiko at ‘yan na ‘ata ang masasabi niyang accomplishments sa buhay­. Sumasama rin siya sa caravan ng mga nakaupong opis­yal ng gobyerno. Maliban diyan, ang ambag lang ni aktor sa Pinas ay walang iba kundi ang offensive, sexist, at dirty jokes. Get’s n’yo mga kosa? Sapat na ba ang mga ‘yan para iboto siya? Araguuyyyyy! Hak hak hak! Hindi lahat grasya sa pagpasok sa pulitika ‘no mga kosa? May gibaan din. Dipugaaaa! Kung walang movie at TV assignments sa ngayon si aktor, ang tanong saan siya kumukuha ng panggastos sa kampanya? Saan galing ang kaching mo Sir? May isang movie columnist na tinawag si aktor na “walang utang na loob” kaya may papatol pa kayang Pinoy na iboto siya? Nakupoooooo! Abangan!"
1,"HINDI nawawala ang dirty tactics ng mga traditional poli­tical clan para manatili sa kanilang kapangyarihan kahit isinusuka na ng kanilang mga kababayan. Ang mga puli­tikong handang maglingkod ng matapat para sa pagba­bago at kaunlaran ay ginigiba. Ganyan ang takbo ng puli­tika sa mga lalawigan. Kinukondisyon nila ang isipan ng mga botante sa pamamagitan ng mga maling impormasyon ipinakakalat, hehehe! Katulad na lamang ni Michael Gerald Thomas Ponce Yatco o Pareng Mike na tumatakbong congressman sa Binan, Laguna. Wala umanong katotohanan ang ipinagkakalat ng mga Alonte na wala na silang kalaban sa dara­ting na May 2022 eleksyon. Dahil ang naging desisyon ng Comelec na idisqualify si Pareng Mike ay hindi pa final at executory at sa halip, maaari pang mag-file ng motion for reconsideration at puwede pa itong dumiretso sa Supreme Court. Ang laban ni Pareng Mike ay laban ng mga taga-Biñan para sa pagbabago. Si Pareng Mike at dating Sen. Ferdi­nand Marcos Jr. ay talagang magkakampi sa partido at ang mga kalaban nila ay isang grupo na parehong guma­gamit ng maruming taktika upang linlangin ang mga botante. Si dating Comelec Comm. Rowena Guanzon na isa sa pumirma ng disqualification ni Pareng Mike ay siya ring nagpahayag sa madlang people na ma-disqualify si Marcos. Ito ang mainit na gusot na iniwan ni Guanzon sa Comelec. Samantala sa Biñan ay may kumakalat na bali-ba­li­tang ginagamit ngayon ng mga Alonte ang pera ng bayan para sa maruming pulitika at pansariling interes. Ewan ko lang kung may katotohanan ito, bukas ang pahina ko sa paglilinaw sa isyung ito. Bukod kay Pareng Mike, lumi­litaw na biktima rin umano ng mga Alonte gamit ang pera ng bayan ang lahat ng mabubuting mamamayan ng Binan. Kaya ang sigaw ng mga nakakaraming residente ng Binan ay “all the way” support sa laban ni Pareng Mike para sa Kongreso. Kahit umano may ipinakakalat na pagbabanta ang kampo ni Alonte  na gagawin ang lahat para mapigilan ang pagbabago sa Binan, ang todong suporta nila sa kandidatura ni Pareng Mike ay lalo lamang umiigting. Para sa inyong kaalaman, sa inilabas na disqualification case ng Comelec noong Enero 26, 2022, sinabing nagsinungaling si Pareng Mike sa kanyang filing of COC dahil noong mag-file ito noong October 25, 2021, hindi pa raw sya registered voter ng Binan. Pero nasa record mismo ng Comelec na registered voter na si Pareng Mike ng Binan noon pang Set. 2, 2021."
1,"Shenanigans and extreme pressure or actions by politicians in many countries have always been deplorable and condemnable. Recently, these have been more pronounced in countries with populist governments with presidents who do not want to relinquish power, and extremely in authoritarian governments. Venezuela, Brazil, and Turkey are some countries in the first category and Russia, China, Myanmar, and North Korea in the second category. Massive and blatant repression, disinformation, and extra-judicial maneuvers are common daily occurrences in these countries. Among countries that still adhere to democratic principles or a semblance of democracy, there is a constant struggle between the people and the governments to rein in the abuses and excesses of the government, and if there are elections the incumbent administrations are usually booted out of the government. The Philippines is in this category Recent events in the Philippines, particularly leading to the May 2022 election are examples of political events and actions that scandalize and outrage the people. The mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic, the graft and corruption in the Pharmally medical supplies procurement, the use of government resources to fund the disinformation campaign, and the pressure tactics on the Commission on Elections on the disqualification case are glaring evidence. So, are people and the voters scandalized and outraged enough? From the main and social media, there is a simmering social outrage. The political handlers are aware of this so that there is a massive counter-propaganda of fake news to push these issues away. The trolls are having a hard time as these are factual issues, and there is an 80/20 dominance of facts about them in the main and social media. Their tactic is diversion from these issues which may not be effective. Like many other Asian societies, Filipinos tend to be non-confrontational in social behavior and this includes their politics. Even when they are totally against, they are silent and keep their peace and become part of the silent majority. They express their opposition in the elections as in the “Pusyon Bisaya” phenomenon in Cebu during the martial law election and in the Cory Aquino win in the snap election in 1985. The EDSA People Power Revolution was the boiling point that was reached after 16 years of abuse under the martial law, so it can be said that Filipinos are “slow burn” people. The advent of social media may have changed these Filipino dynamics. In social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube, Tiktok, Messenger, and Viber, Filipinos have become more vocal and confrontational. Unlike the trolls that are using fictitious identities, people expressing strong views are using real names/identities. The remaining silent majority are only those middle-aged and senior citizens who are not tech savvy enough to use social media. Still, these are also the people who cheered when the Ampatuans lost all political power, and when senators Enrile, Revilla, and Estrada were all indicted for graft and corruption. There is always a quiet outrage against politicians from people in all classes on abuses of power. Outrage is a people’s reaction to extreme violation of moral standards by politicians because we believe we are all subject to the same moral and ethical laws. So politicians acting like they are above the law and moral standards undermine the basis of social order which is a prerequisite for economic development. Even without the moral tenets of religion, the natural law of truth and justice has to be enforced for the orderly interaction among people. It seems that democracy is the form of government that promotes social justice and avoids the abuses of governments, so it is incumbent upon the governed to be scandalized and outraged by the excesses of politicians and governments."
1,"Ang political interview sa mga kandidato dili angayan nga palabyon bisan si kinsa pa ang mohimo sa interview. Kini tungod kay sa interview nato makita, mahimbisan ug makilatis ang kahanas o kahaniti, sa kandidato sa pinaagi sa pagtubag sa mga pangotana nga gibato ngadto kanila. Sa interview makita pod sa mga tawo nga naminaw ug nagtan-aw ang pagka-mature na sa politika sa usa ka kandidato. Sa interview sa usa ka kandidato sa pagka presidente nga si Manila Mayor Francisco “Isko” Moreno Domagoso, gipakita niini ang iyang maturity sa politika tungod sa pamahayag niini nga sa iyang pagdumala sa nasud dili siya magbaton og pagdumot ug dili siya magtingoha nga manimalos. Itugyan na lang kuno nila sa hukmanan ang pagsilot sa mga nakahimo og anomaliya ug nga ipunting na lamang ang iyang attention pagpalambo ang kinabuhi sa katawhang Pilipinhon. Kini ang pamahayag sa kampo ni Senador Panfilo “Ping” Lacson, laing kandidato sa pagka presidente karong umaabot Mayo 9 nga bugnong lugaynon. Ang tigpamaba sa kampo ni Lacson nga si kanhi partylist congressman Ashley “Ace” Acidillo miingon nga bisan sa wala pa magsugod ang opisyal nga kampanya daan nang gipadayag ni Senador Lacson nga dili mayo ang linabayay og lapok sa mga kandidato. Ang linabayay og lapok panahon sa kampanya sa mga kandidato timailhan kini sa kakuwang sa political maturity sa mga kandidato. Ang kahilig usab maminaw sa mga botante sa bisan unsang matang sa lapok nga gilabay sa isig ka kandidato timailhan usab sa kakuwang sa maturity sa mga botante. Bisan tuod tinuod nga kabahin sa paghashas, paghimbis ug pagkilatis  sa mga kandidato ang pag-ila sa ilang pagkatawo, apan mas maayo nga maoy ipatigbabaw ang pag-ila ug pagsuta sa kamaayo sa ilang mga plano o plata porma de pang gobyerno. Gikinanglan na ang taas nga level sa kampanya diin nakatotok kini sa mga plano ug plata porma de pang gobiyerno nga itanyag sa mga kandidato ngadto sa katawhan nga maoy magbutang kanila sa katungdanan."
1,"Opisyal na nga giindorso sa partidong Barug-PDP nga gipangulohan ni Cebu City Mayor Mike Rama ang BBM-Sara tandem, si presidential aspirant Bongbong Marcos ug kapares niini nga si vice presidential aspirant Sara Duterte sa umaabot eleksyon. Giapahibawo kini mismo ni Rama atol sa presscon niadtong nakalabayng adlaw didto sa Rama compound human sa ilang meeting sa mga miembro sa partido. Kahinumduman nga mipadayag ang mayor kaniadto nga maghuwat siya sa iindorso ni President Rodrigo Duterte nga mao usab ang ilang pilion apan wala pa man mo-endorse si Presidente Duterte og mga kandidato nga suportahan. Suod si Rama ni Senador Bong Go nga maoy most trusted sa pangulo busa posibleng gihonghongan o gihatagan na og clearance niini ang mayor nga pwede na siya mag una una sa pagpahibawo sa ilang suportahan. Sa karon, tataw ug dayag na kinsa ang gipaluyohan sa mga major parties sa dakbayan sa Sugbo diin ang kampo sa BOPK una nang mipadayag sa ilang gisuportahan nga mao si Vice President ug presidential aspirant Leny Robredo, gawas lang seguro ni vice mayoralty candidate Franklin Ong nga mora’g lahi ang suportahan. Si mayoralty candidate nga si Konsehal Dave Tumulak wala pa usab mobutag kinsa ang iyang suportahan sa mga national aspirants. Balikan nako ang sitwasyon sa local administration party o kampo ni Mayor Rama, atol sa ilang presscon ang BARUG-PDP ra man. Unsa nahitabo sa kaalyado nilang Partido Panaghiusa nga gipangulohan ni Atty. Joey Daluz? Impossible kaayo nga mosuporta si Daluz kang Marcos nga ang inahan niini nga si Inday Nita nabantog man kadto nga anti Marcos, out of the picture na ang Panaghiusa party kong BBM na ang hisgotan. Hinoon walay kwestyon sa kang Sara Duterte kay mao gyud kini ang suportahan sa grupo. Mura'g kulba hinam ang mosunod nga panghitabo sa politika sa Cebu City kay murag dunay twist nga mahitabo. Unsa man magpabilin pa ba nga kaalyado sa BARUG-PDP ang Panaghiusa ni Daluz o posible kaha nga mobuwag na sa hingpit ug makig alyansa sa laing kandidato? Mga pangutana lang kini nga seguradong matubag sa umaabot nga mga adlaw. Dunay mga prinsipyo nga maapektohan sa panahon sa politika, akong himoong sanglitanan si Konsehal James Athony Cuenco ang anak ni kanhi Congressman Antonio Cuenco nga nailang anti martial law crusader o anti Marcos sama ni Inday Nita. Kauban siya sa BARUG-PDP nga miindorso kang BBM, akong gipangutana human sa presscon diin matud niya nga desisyon kini sa partido ug dili usab siya makasupak. Hinuon sa personal niyang gibati nagpabilin gihapon ang mithi sa iyang amahan. Desisyon nila ang tanan kon asa sa tan-aw nga makaayo nila sa umaabot nga eleksyon kay kong modaug man makapadayon sila sa ilang serbisyo. Sa sitwasyon sa BARUG-PDP basin sa presidentiable lang nagkasungi ang ilang prinsipyo ug dili maapektohan ang lokal nga kamada ug magpabiling lig-on ang ilang panag alyansa. Posible kaha nga magkahiusa gihapon ang grupo bisan managlahing manok ang iindorso?"
1,"Even the quality of political ads has deteriorated to the level of the ridiculous. Aren't you exasperated by the trash being peddled by many ads? If these guys want to become president or senator, they better give us a sensible message, one that is not too complicated for the masses to comprehend, but not too idiotic either for the intelligent voters to appreciate. Both the candidates and their advertising service providers should not look down on Filipinos as if voters are morons or imbeciles, or treat masses with patronizing condescension. They should give dignity to their ads and add wisdom to their message. Above all, their ads should have some socially-redeeming values. They should not insult our level of understanding. On this score, I find VP Leni's ads well-thought of, respectful, and very positive. VP Leni doesn’t rewrite history or base her ads on fake news or distortions of realities. There is, for instance, a TV ad of a former vice president who is running for senator (let’s hide him by the name of Jojo Binay) and his political advertisement and the line that he uses to get his message across is ""Siya Lang, Siya Lang"", claiming monopoly of public service, alleging that he and he alone has served the people. My God, can you believe that? Is this the same guy who ran for congressman in Makati in 2019 and lost to his former-ally-turned-political detractor? Siya lang, siya lang talaga. He might be the only former VP who ran for congressman and lost in his own so-called bailiwick. If he loses again, he is politically dead. Then there’s a former Cabinet member running for senator (the son of a multi-billionaire real estate magnate who ran for president and lost). His mom is also an incumbent senator who reportedly aspires to become the next Senate president. His wife is an incumbent undersecretary of justice, a former member of the House herself. His sister is also an incumbent member of the House representing the lone district of Las Piñas. The mayorship of their city has always been in the hands of this maternal family. If we are looking for a perfect illustration of a family dynasty, like the Marcoses, Dutertes, and Macapagal Arroyos, theirs is a perfect fit. Let us just hide him by the name of Mark Villar. Why do the Villar advertisements insult our intelligence? Simply because his only message is: ""Si Mark tahimik lang"". My God, is being tahimik the new badge of competence and fitness for senator? Have they amended the Constitution and inserted being silent and meek as one qualification for the Senate? We already have a lot of senators who are silent and meek and they haven’t elevated the degree of wisdom among the senators. They don’t participate in discussions and debates because they have nothing to bring to the august body. They are merely popular because they are actors, and dance the “budots” and the electorate just checked their names in the ballot. Another claim is that according to the president, Harry Roque is the best presidential spokesman. My Lord, and my God. No further comment, your honor. There is a senator who claims to be the TESDA man. My God, since when did he obtain an exclusive franchise to claim such an honor? Not even the great and venerable Blas Ople and his brilliant brother Bernie Ople who first founded and organized the National Manpower and Youth Council or NMYC, the forerunner of TESDA, ever claimed such honor. What has Senator Joel Villanueva done in TESDA that was earth-shaking, extraordinary, and draconian? Nothing that I know of. It’s just pure and simple image making and projection. Nothing more. And what has Win Gatchalian done on education to claim that as his advocacy? Senator Joel Villanueva claims that ""trabaho ang trabaho ko sa senado"". How many jobs has he created and how? Then Congressman Alan Peter wants to join his sister Pia again in the same chamber, promising ?10,000 to each family. Where will he get the money? The country has a ?13-trillion national debt. Is he intending to impose more taxes to fund his promises? How many Cayetanos are in government? And what have they done for the country? If they have nothing else to do, they shouldn’t be doing these at the expense of Filipinos. If they have nothing sensible and truthful to say, they can serve the nation better if they keep their peace and not add more garbage to this very dirty world."

1,"When one or two families, by deliberate intent and repeated willfulness, grab all the positions whether in local or national branches of government, then power is concentrated in only one privileged family or clan, to the exclusion of all others. If those who control the economy in one city or district also deliberately control political powers, then all the rest are marginalized. The country becomes their family corporation and the resources come under their complete control and domination. Family dynasties make a mockery of our democracy and selfishly monopolize decision-making in the whole nation and in the locality. They make their own relatives practically the rulers and the rest of the people as their subjects and the local government units as their vassals. It cannot be fairly argued that anyway, they were elected, and it is the people who decide. That is a fallacy. The elections are farcical because the people are not given choices. When the poor try to run, they are immediately declared nuisance candidates. Only the rich can finance a national campaign, therefore to be bonafide candidates means to be well-funded, and well-connected. I will call a spade a spade. I will not mince words, I will tell the truth. The Marcoses and the Dutertes are the most blatant examples of family dynasties. In the case of the Marcoses, the father is running for president, the aunt is an incumbent senator. The sons, daughters, nephews, and nieces are running for all the legislative and executive positions. The Dutertes, for the longest time, had been in control of Davao, father, daughter, son, and soon grandchildren most probably. That is why Marcos and Duterte are compatible. They are supported by the dynasties of GMA, Erap Estrada, and the Romualdez Clan of Leyte, as well as the Villar Empire of Las Piñas. The same is true with the Singsons in Ilocos Sur, the Ortegas of La Union, the Dys and Albanos of Isabella, the Umalis of Nueva Ecija, the Suarez Clan of Quezon, the Angaras of Aurora, the Cojuangcos of Tarlac, the Espinos of Pangasinan, the Rectos of Batangas, the Revillas, Remullas, and Tolentinos of Cavite, the Gatchalians of Valenzuela, the Zamoras of San Juan, the Olivarez and Bernabe families of Parañaque, and the Cayetanos of Taguig. All the provinces, all the towns, and all the cities are in the hands of an elite family. The common folks rarely have a chance. Here in Cebu, if you are not a Garcia, Osmeña, Rama, Salimbangon, Abellanosa, Del Mar, Durano, Martinez, Calderon, Radaza, Cortez, or Ouano, then you are nothing. You need to be extraordinarily rich, or exceedingly loved to be able to fight a dynasty. In Carcar, Naga, Danao, Mandaue, Lapu-Lapu, and Bogo, only one or two families are controlling political power; husband and wife, father and son, or brother and sister. It is a virtual family business. They make all the important decisions, control all the funds and claim all the credits but never accept responsibility for failures and debacles. They either blame Odette or COVID-19. Their dynasties do not accept accountability at all. Once in a while, an unknown, unconnected extraordinary guy wins. But he or she must either be a famous basketball player, an actor, or a comedian with truckloads of money to neutralize the powers of dynasties. There are many better Cebuanos who are more competent, more honest, and more trustworthy. But they cannot wage a campaign for sheer lack of logistics and machinery. The bottom line is money, not intellect, not integrity. Our political system is rotten, in the hands of greedy dynasties. I told you, I do not mince words."
1,"Duna koy daan nga clipping, ambot unsa ning tuiga nako na-clipped bahin niining atong ulohan karwon, sinuwat ni Julio Teehankee, full professor of political science and international studies, De La Salle University. Akong tan-aw medyo relevant pa kini karon. Ania ang binuksan niyang pamahayage: “Elections are integral tyo democratic governance. Through the mechanism of elections, politicians and held accountable for their actions, and arwe compelled to introduce policies that are reflective of and responsive to public opinion.” So, ang eleksyon, sama sa nangagi ug sa umaabot nga eleksyon, kabahin kini sa demokratikanhong pagpangagamhanan. Othberwise, dili kita makahisgot og demokrasya kon walay election. Gumikan niini ang mga politiko adunay tulobagon kon accountable sa ilang mga aksiyon, o sa ilang mga b inuhatan isiop omga public servants o mga suluguon (unta) sa lungsod. Ug sa samang higayon, maka-introduce sila’g mga policies ug mga patakaran nga mosanong sa kabubut-on sa lungsod o sa opinion publiko. Ang ilang mga panlantaw kinahanglan mohaum sa mga gihandom nga kaugmaran alang sa kabulahanan  sa kinatibuk-ang bahin sa katawhan. Sa Kapitolyo atong mabasa ang giingon nga ang gahum sa gobyerno nagagikan sa katawhan. Ug sa city hall, gipahinumduman silang mga nag-alagad sa gobiyerno nga ang ilang pagka-anaa sa gobyerno, is a public trust. Kining tanang atong ma-realized pinaagi sa eleksyon, ang tiunay nga pagpangalad publiko mag-agad man sa katarong ug katakos sa mga elective public servants nga atong gipili. So, kinahanglan nga sa tanang higayon, ang kabubut-on sa mga pumipili, the will of the electorate mao gyud ang mopatigbabaw. Apan, matud pa dinhi. “These do not, however, prevent thbe distortion of the will of the electorate in a ‘flawed democracy’ in the Philippines. Flawed democracy kono. Mao ba kini ang nahitabo sa atong nasud, gumikan sa atong electoral system, ang plurality system? Matud pa: “Under the 1987 constitution, all elective officials - president, vice-president, senators, members of the House of Representatives, local chief executives and local legislators - are chosen by a direct vote of the people through a ‘first-past-the-post system’ (Agra,l 1997b: 1). The Philippine electoral system has generally been consistent throught history. Direct vote sa katawhan, sa ato pa, kita gayud ang magbuot kinsa ang atong palingkuron diha sa mga gahom ug posisyon sa atong pangagamhanan. Busa, kinahanglan awtong ibasi ang atong pagbotar, dili sa salapi o popularity, kundili, sa katakos ug kaligdong sa buot atong pilion. Sa ato nang gibalikbalik dinhi, sagrado ang balota, kinahanglan ato kining ampingan ug panalipdan batok niadtong  buot manamastamas niini pinaagi sa pagbaligya niini. Ang nakadaut kay daghan man usab ang mopalit niini. Kinsa man ang nag-una niini, sama sa itlog o ang nangitlog? Kon walay mamaligya, wa puy mopalit, kay unsa may paliton kon walay baligya? Apan, usahay gud, ang mga pumapalit may manghagad, ug mo-offer og taas nga kantidad, nga ang mamaligyaay dili kabalibad. Apan, alang nako, kon ang tanang botante dili gayud mobaligya sa ilang mga katungod pagbotar, walay mahimo ang atong mga politiko niini. On the other hand, kon walay mamalitay, wa puy mamaligyaay, kay unsaon pagkahalin sa iyang balota ko walay mopalit? Dugang ni Teehankee: “Cientalism, favourism, nepotism, fraud and violence, among others, have reinforced the elitist nature of Philippine electoral politics. This was exacerbated during the period of Marcos’ authoritarian rule as democratic elections.”"
1,"Political surveys can never assure any candidate of a sure victory. The only survey that counts is on election day. In 2016, Grace Poe and Mar Roxas were leading in the surveys. What happened? A Duterte-come-lately surged suddenly and overwhelmed both Roxas and Poe. In 2010, Manny Villar was topping the surveys followed by Erap. What happened? PNoy clinched the presidency. In 2004, Fernando Poe Jr. was dominating all the surveys. What happened? GMA stole the presidency. In 1992, Miriam was dominating all the surveys. What happened? FVR captured the presidency with a measly 23% of the total votes. It was only in 1998 when Erap was a clear winner from the very beginning and Joe de Venecia, although supported by the incumbent president, FVR, and given aid and comfort by the administration's ruling party, never had a Chinaman's chance. Once the Commission on Elections shall have come out with the decision in just one of the eight cases against BBM, his supporters are going to shift allegiance to the other candidates. That survey lead of more than 50 will do him nothing at all. In the first place, I have my strong doubts about that number, which borders on statistical improbability. You know moneyed candidates have many tactics of influencing the results of surveys. I do not believe that less than 5,000 respondents can speak for the more than 70 million voters come May 9, no matter how random the sampling is and no matter how the data gatherers would choose the respondents. It would be the greatest faux pas for the Marcos camp to lull themselves into the illusion that the presidency is already in the bag for their candidate. Grace Poe committed that grave mistake in 2016, and so it was also for Mar Roxas who trusted too much in the fact that he enjoyed tremendous support from PNoy and the incumbent government. They were using government assets in their campaign. They had control over the local officials. But when the people themselves decide to take a stand, the administration cannot turn the tide of the popular will. Duterte did not have a single governor supporting him. He had only two out of more than 300 congressmen. Look what happened. The support of incumbent presidents is not a guarantee either. Look what happened to Gibo Teodoro who was hundred times more competent, more brainy, and more prepared than his cousin PNoy. The endorsement and all-out support of a very unpopular president GMA proved to be the kiss of death to Gibo's presidential run. But even the popular FVR could not make fellow Pangasinense Joe de Venevia win, despite all the resources of the government. Well, Ramon Magsaysay won over his own boss, Elpidio Quirino, as then vice president Diosdado Macapagal won over incumbent Carlos P. Garcia. I have a strong feeling that the Marcoses cannot come back to Malacañang. The Marcoses had done too much damage to the country and it would be the greatest historical mistake to allow them back into power. The Marcoses have inflicted too much damage on the Cebuanos. Those who claim to be loyal to BBM do not know anything about how Cebuanos suffered under martial law."
1,"If I were to prepare a memo to the next president of this republic, I would ask him or her (hopefully, her) to focus on the following top priorities. First; poverty and economic collapse. Second; social injustice. Third; crime and corruption. Fourth; peace and order, national security, and territorial integrity. Fifth; disaster preparedness. Sixth; unemployment and lack of enterprises. Seventh; health, education, and housing. And, eighth; agriculture and food security. Poverty is caused by the confluence of many factors; overpopulation, unequal opportunities for human development, corruption, mismanagement of the Philippine economy, and the flawed character of both the national leaders and the people themselves. There is too much social injustice. The factors of production like land, capital, and other resources are controlled by some well-entrenched clans and families that control the economy, the social structures, and also politics. Around 99% of the people do not have meaningful participation in all spheres of development, except to work. And the fruits of their labor are not equitably shared and distributed. Crime and corruption have not been reduced in the last six years. There are even strong allegations that many of such crimes are state-sponsored or government-led. Hundreds of lawyers, judges, and journalists have been killed or subjected to extrajudicial killing. We cannot single out the government as the perpetrator of these summary executions. For all we know these are done precisely by the communists or global terrorists precisely to weaken the government's credibility with the people. But while we do not point accusing fingers at the police, the military, or the political leaders, we should insist that they have failed to stop these under their watch and before their very eyes. Needless for us to repeat bewailing the inability of government to stand up to China in the West Philippine Sea. The government had been very harsh in its words against the US (and perhaps, rightly so), but this administration has been very subservient to the importuning of Beijing. While our president, with undisguised braggadocio, would lambast US presidents, we bow like meek lambs before China. And this could not be rightly so. Another flaw in our public administration is our failure to institute a strong and credible disaster preparedness program. We repeatedly suffer every after hurricane, because we never try to learn. Unemployment and outward labor migration is the new social cancer that is killing our country. Jobless people are homeless and thus most of them are hopeless. The government, instead of frontally attacking the talent diaspora and grabbing that problem by the horns, is sending signals to exacerbate the malady by creating a separate department for migrant workers. Thus, we send thousands of mothers to work as maids, leaving husbands to play unfaithful spouses, and abandoning children to the hazards of drugs, delinquency, teenage pregnancy, illicit sex, and petty crimes. The quality of education and public healthcare as well as housing has deteriorated with alarming incidence, speed, and consequences. The people are poor, they face food insecurity. Their wages are not enough for basic needs all the while the oligarchs are raking in billions in profits. Foreign contractors and suppliers are committing massive frauds, and politicians' greed for power remain insatiable and unabated. The next president should be like a superhero, whoever that might be, he or she must always bear in mind that ""with great power comes great responsibility""."
1,"Today is Innocents Day. People will play tricks on the innocents, the impressionable and the neophytes whose minds are pure and simple. Tricksters, shysters, estafadoras, and plain mangingilads, will tell us a lot of foolish jokes, deceiving and defrauding us and seducing our naive minds into parting with our money, honor, or virginity. Let us beware like the Trojans should when the Greeks come bringing gifts. Never believe the promises of politicians, they are worse than deceitful suitors who promise the moon and the stars. They will promise to make mountains out of molehills and to make valleys out of mountains. They will promise to build bridges, and if you have no rivers they will promise to first build rivers too. They claim to be experts in almost all trades and admit to no inadequacies. They claim that they are omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent, and they can even predict the past and recall the future. Politicians are the worst species of deceivers in the lowest phylum of the animal kingdom. Pacman promised to give a house and lot to every Filipino, and Ping Lacson promised a ?5,000 allowance every month for every student. These guys are just taking us for a ride. Where shall they get the budget? Bongbong Marcos promised that all Filipinos shall rise again together. His late dictator dad promised that this nation shall be great again. Well, if BBM wins, this nation will surely regret again. Isko made a lot of promises to Cebu just to seduce the more than 3.2 million voters in our premier province Why do you think Isko keeps on coming to town just like Santa Claus? If you believe that Isko comes to our province because he loves the Cebuanos, you must be kidding yourselves, or you must have been born yesterday. He promised that Cebu will be given priority in infrastructures under his administration. Tell that to the marines. Isko has not even solved the congestion problems, crimes, and social maladies of Tondo, his home community, where he used to roam around in his boyhood days. Why would he give attention to Cebu? Well anyway, I am sure that such attention will never happen because he will never win. The people know better. Why would you believe Gatchalian if he claims that he is the advocate for education? What has he done for the teachers? Why would you believe that Villanueva is the TESDA man, what monumental achievements can be attributed to him in TESDA? Why would you believe Alan Peter when he promises to give ?10,000 to every Filipino? Where shall he get the money? President Duterte promised to end drugs in six months. Six years are going to pass without even a small dint of that malady. The crime rate is still high, poverty has become worse, our national debt is in the vicinity of ?13 trillion, and the people are losing faith in the government. The president promised to end corruption, what happens now with the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee's many exposés? He promised to end contractualization, what has been done along that line? He promised to ride roughshod on a water ski to the West Philippine Sea. Now, it turns out that we were plain stupid to have taken his word for it. It was just a hyperbole or a politician's figure of speech. And so, would you still take the trapos’ words seriously? Oh, come on, don't be that innocent."
1,"CEBU, Philippines —  Newly revived political party, Partido Panaghiusa, is pushing for two more congressional districts in Cebu City. Lawyer Joey Daluz, party president, believes that the city is underrepresented in congress with only two congressmen. With a population of 1.1 million, Daluz said that Cebu City should now have at least four congressional seats. According to Daluz, creating two more congressional districts in Cebu City would be a priority of Partido Panaghiusa if their candidates for congress will win in the 2022 elections. The party is supporting the candidacy of Councilor Niña Mabatid in the North District and Councilor Eduardo Rama in the South District. Population is among the requirements for the reapportionment of legislative districts pursuant to Section 5, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution, which requires the minimum population of 250,000 per legislative district. Based on the 2020 census, Cebu City has a population of 964,169, making it the fifth-most populated city in the country and the most populous in the Visayas. “If modaog si Niña ug si Edu, atong himoon ang Cebu City og upat ka distrito. Qualified na ta, dinhi sa atoa, naa na ta'y 1.1 million residents unya ang requirement sa usa ka distrito kay 250,000 ra, so alkansi na ta sa uban actually,” Daluz said. Daluz said the city needs more representations in Congress not only for political leverage but for more projects. The idea of creating more congressional districts in Cebu City was first pushed by actor Richard Yap, who is running for congress in the North District. Yap said, if he wins in the 2022 elections, he wants to focus more on the needs of the people in the mountain barangays especially in terms of health services and education. He believes that this can only be achieved if at least one more representation for Cebu City is added in Congress. Daluz is also hopeful that the city will get an extra seat in Congress if the STL Partylist that his party is campaigning for will win. He said the said partylist will also bring in projects for the city. ""Kung makadaog ang STL, lima na ka mga kongresista ang maghatag og kaayohan sa siyudad ,"" Daluz said. One of the nominees of STL Partylist is former Cebu City Medical Center (CCMC) administrator Yvonne Cania. – FPL (FREEMAN)"
1,"TEMPORARY. Two brothers are now fighting because they support different candidates for president and actually feel strongly about their beliefs. Each one is convinced the other is supporting the wrong candidate. Their older brother had sage advice: Politics is temporary, family is forever. “Pakamatyan ninyo ‘nang kandidato nga wa kaila ninyo? Unya inig human sa eleksyon kamo ra gihapon ang mag-abot?” he told them. So far they have not taken his advice."
1,"I sat as a panelist for some thesis students who were doing significant studies as Communication students. They were particularly peering into content posted on the internet such as those on Twitter and YouTube which are evident nowadays. I was particularly drawn to one study where they tried to prove that celebrities and their presence on the internet taking sides on certain political issues would make an impact. They coined the term ""celebrity activist"" where the already-known star would try to manipulate the public with content pertaining to a specific stand on issues reaching to endorsing a certain political candidate for the 2022 elections. They are trying to unmask the cloak of fame brought about by the personas of these individuals who are bringing their ideals to free-to-use platforms such as Twitter. This is not a new phenomenon. In the United States, there are certain stars who endorse candidates not just via paid advertisements but also on their personal spaces, even during their concerts, because they feel so strongly about the issues surrounding their country. In the Philippines, there are also a lot of artists who were instrumental during the lifting of martial law. It was the convergence of talents to best express what the ordinary Filipino felt after years of bondage. Today, there is a parallel behavior but the platform is different. What makes it worse is the vulnerability of these public spaces to these celebrity activists. They are attacked by trolls, bashed by those who are influenced by them, and they in turn steer the discourse the other way around. It is a poor display of interaction with legitimate issues to talk about. These artists could not just rally in the streets and sing the anthem of the times. First, we are in a pandemic, and second, the chilling effect to protest against the current administration still persists. We cannot deny that the role of celebrities in society can be so striking and influential that some of them even turn into politicians. Some even marry public officials, thus maintaining the same clout that they had with their career and adding another sphere to it. Somehow, we can see the generosity but the intention behind it is invisible to the audience. This is very crucial in consuming their content. This will be very useful as we make our decisions for the elections next year. We must make sure that the ballot is not persuaded by the celebrity endorsing it or its engagement on social media but by the decisions that we made. These would be based on track record and performance. We know that all too well. For now, my social media accounts are filtered to remove these activists so that I cannot read whatever they have to say. They would either stress me out or trigger me. For what it's worth, the pandemic has also taught me that mental health does indeed matter."
1,"In this country, when the father who is a great politico, is term-limited or dies, or is too old, either the son, the wife or the daughter is pushed to take his place, as if the country, the province, city or town is their personal hacienda or family corporation. Political dynasties behave as if they are the majority stockholders of the whole nation or local constituencies. This must be stopped. For instance, Don Sergio Osmeñas was undoubtedly Cebu's greatest political leader. But did Serging Osmeña Jr. inherit his trait? I don't think so. In fact, Don Sergio founded the Nacionalista Party, never left it and died as an NP. Serging shifted to LP, founded by the nemesis of his father, Manuel Roxas, who betrayed Don Sergio and defeated the grand old man of Cebu. Serging did not imbibe the value of party loyalty exemplified by Don Sergio. I don't know about Tomas, Serge, and the late Sonny, Lito, and the other Osmeñas. No one could ever hold a candle to the greatness of Don Sergio. Why has no city or town in Cebu ever been named in his honor? Did Pablo John Garcia inherit any of the marks of greatness of the late Noy Pabling Garcia? No comment on that for I have no sufficient facts with which to form a fair opinion about him. Did Ace Durano ever inherit any of the great characters of Mano Amon Durano, his famous grandpa? I don't think so. Did Peter John Calderon also imbibe some of the great traits of Mano Amon? No visible evidence, your honor, with due respect to the honorable congressman from the 7th District. And did vice governor Junjun Davide inherit some of the outstanding qualities of Chief Justice Jun Davide? Well, in fairness, I can see the humility, the gentlemanly demeanor, the honesty, and the trustworthiness of Hilario Davide III. Did Samsam Gullas inherit some of the excellent values, attitudes, and behavior of the eminent and venerable Eddie Gullas? Yes, it is very evident that Samsam is a very focused, committed, pro-people, hardworking public servant who is honest and very faithful to the peoples' trust. I think that because of Samsam and Junjun, I can accept an exception to my strong advocacy against political dynasties. But I don't know much about this BG Abellanosa who seeks to replace his father, Bebot Abellanosa, to represent Cebu City South District in the Lower House. I always believe that the best representative that this district should have elected is Atty. Joy Pesquera. But she is running for a city council seat. Can Bongbong ever hope to become worthy to take over the seat that his father used to occupy? I said no, far from it. His father was a Bar topnotcher, an outstanding congressman, an outstanding senator, a Senate president. He could speak extemporaneously before the UN General Assembly, and FM was given a standing ovation by the joint session of the US Congress. Bongbong is not even one tenth of his father's stature. What degree does BBM have? Honestly, my dear, I do not know and I do not care. How about Sara? Well she can be even greater than her father but the president is definitely the more astute (shrewd may be the better term) politician. I conclude that greatness cannot be inherited. It is something that the young should work out for themselves as the old did too in their own time. Greatness is a product of genetics and environment, but also largely free will, determination and hard work, a good mind, a good heart, and a good conscience blessed by God."
1,"The campaign period has not officially started, but if you tell me that the mayors and the governors have not yet begun campaigning, I would tell you: Tell that to the marines. I was not born yesterday. Politicians do campaign every minute of their political life. They even campaign in their sleep and in their dreams. Politicians are voraciously addicted to campaigning. And so, while they are out of the office, what are the underlings and subalterns doing? Many of the capitol and city hall personnel, especially the heads of the different departments are always late, coming to the office at ten and going home at three or even after lunch. Only the rank-and-file, the casuals, the job order workers and the contract employees report devotedly on time. The middle managers always have excuses: they have breakfast meetings, lunch meetings and even dinners, not to mention the merienda in the morning and that in the afternoon. They just go to the office to sign documents, give instructions and meet some chosen, big-time people, or the VIPs. Many of those left behind to man the ramparts are without direct supervision. They are underpaid, overworked and underappreciated. That is why most of them are ''suplado'' or “suplada.” They do not have simple courtesies. They do not even look at people directly. They make people wait and line up, and there is no special care for the seniors, PWDs and pregnant women. The taxpayers and those paying their dues at the Treasurers' offices are made to wait as if they are not the sovereign people. The underlings behave as if they are not the public servants. These are the small subalterns who sabotage the good image of the mayors and the governors. Even if you say that our governor or mayor is always caring but his or her people down the line are discourteous, uncaring, even very hard to deal with, then everything is laid to waste. The mayors and the governors are judged on the basis of how the people deliver services. The people may not have the chance to have direct interaction with the chief executive of the province and the city and thus, they evaluate the effectiveness of their mayors and governors on the basis of how the underlings treat them. That is what I call the tyranny of the underlings. And so, mayors and governors, look at your own house. Evaluate your own people. Your greatest enemies are not your political rivals. Your enemies are inside your own offices. They make you look bad. Gid rid of them or give them a guru to mentor, counsel and coach their ranks. There are ways by which their behavior can be turned around. But it needs a world class expert to make that happen. There are solutions looking for the problems, if you have the problems looking for the solutions. Better do it now or regret later."
1,"The Philippines started as a beautiful paradise. It is a big body of water sprinkled with 7,107 islands and people who were happy, free, and enjoying a life of peace, serenity, and harmony. Gifted with rich natural resources, located in a tropical region, with fine weather and a very beautiful topography, plenty of marine resources, verdant forests, rich deposits of gold and other natural resources. Then the serpents destroyed it. In today's celebration of the Feast of the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception, in the first reading, taken from Genesis, Chapter 3, verses 9 to 15, we are reminded of the Fall of Man in Paradise. Adam was tempted by Eve, who was first tempted by the serpent. Eve succumbed to the enticements of knowledge, of power, of material possessions. Until today, the Filipinos are still being tempted by politicians who are nothing better than serpents. And our people always fall for such temptations. We never learn. Every election, the serpents deceive us, hoodwink us, buy our votes, and cheat in the counting. And when they are elected, they plunder our national coffers. And we call these serpents honorable. The politicians are today's serpents, and they are the ones who entice people to accept and eat the forbidden apples, promising prosperity, peace, prestige, power, and possessions. The eating of the apples is the casting of the votes. These dirty politicians come knocking at our doors every three years, offering to serve us, only to deceive us, to mislead us, to manipulate our weaknesses, to take advantage of our naiveté, our lack of wisdom, discernment, and foresight. And the wonder of it all, we always take their words and believe, for they are like false prophets dressed like meek lambs but are actually beastly serpents poised to devour us and eat us alive. Yet, we call them honorable. These politicians give us a few kilos of rice and a few cans of cheap sardines, purchased from conniving suppliers who, of course, by SOP, overprice each item and amass millions, a big slice of which is agreed tacitly to be given to the politicians as kickbacks. Even COVID-19-related supplies, according to the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee, have been grossly overpriced. These trapos connive with contractors to cheat on the quality of bridges and highways and get billions of juicy contracts. The people are being fried using the oil from their own taxes. And the unthinking citizenry, thank the trapos profusely, bow before these rascals in business suits and call them honorable. The local candidates get billions from national aspirants for president and vice president, and then declare their support, as if their endorsements are for sale. Senators also pay their courtesies to the mayors and governors, and by that, it means, sackloads of cash to use in buying votes come election time. Even partylist candidates give millions just to be endorsed. And so, every local election held simultaneously with presidential polls will surely make the mayors and the governors rich. Some of them may lose the elections but make them win in millions. And we call them honorable. When the serpents visit our towns, we prepare lavish foods, we offer sumptuous dinners, we give them entertainment, knowing fully well that these are the very people who suck our blood, rob our coffers, burden us with too much taxes and make life difficult for us and our children. And yet we bow before them, and call them honorable. If we are not crazy, silly, or stupid, then we are out of our minds. Time to come to our senses. Time to drive them from our paradise. For a start, let's stop calling them honorable."
1,"On the basis of the inanities currently coming out in the main and social media about Philippine politics, it is safe to conclude that most Filipino politicians underestimate the intelligence of the Filipino voters. The disregard for rules and common decency in the filing of their certificates of candidacy, the reservation/substitution of candidates, the unholy alliances and coalitions, and total disregard for leadership principles, morals, and ethics are actually insulting the people and the voters. Even forgiving that, these politicians are all violating the law on early campaigning, and that most of them are running under the forgettable names of resurrected political parties, their platforms and programs are relegated behind personality popularity promotions, fake news, and dubious coalitions with power brokers for command votes and money. To the traditional politicians, ward leaders and political promoters, these developments are opportunities to make money and possible connections with the potential winning candidates. Duterte promised “sako-sakong pera” to his allies and Pacquiao and Moreno have been handing out ?1,000 bills. For the incumbent local government officials, these are possible free rides for money and continuing power from the national candidates. To the ordinary Filipinos who are not politically connected, this current political circus is not good and will have bad consequences if the wrong people get elected. To the lowest 15% in the poverty level who vote for the money, it may maintain or worsen their economic condition. The next 15% of the lower class, who have access to more news and information, will still accept the money but may vote according to their perception and choice. The next 60% in the economic level, which is from the low middle class to the high middle class, will be the most affected in the coming election. They are worried where the country is going now and where it will be going after the election. They are in a state of angst compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic, and wary of an uncertain future. They are more informed and politically savvy than the lower class, and have the traditional moral values of truth, justice, freedom, liberty, and respect for human rights. Most are members of organized religions that reinforce their moral and ethical beliefs. These are the people that are most scandalized and “insulted” by the ongoing political developments in the country. The 10% upper class are of the same sentiment as the middle class, supportive of their values and aspirations but have better options in their livelihood and survival in political changes. So, this economic class will join the “insulted” middle class in their political movement. This will be the main battleground in the coming 2022 election. In the last 50 years of Philippine political history, there were three events that supported the strength of the middle class. First, is the Pusyon Bisaya Party winning all the congressional districts in Cebu Province in the 1970’s sham election during the Martial Law years. They won against all the political families; the Osmeñas, the Duranos, the Cuencos, the Gullases, and the Garcias all together. Second, the EDSA People Power Revolution. The four million who went to EDSA and other public places in the country, and the 25 million supporters protesting against the government were 70% middle class. The third is the votes for Miriam Defensor Santiago when she ran for president. Her votes were largely middle class with many from the students, and very few were from the traditional political parties. Due to the Philippines’ erratic economic growth since 1965 up to 2021, with good GDP growth in the years we had good government, the percentage distribution by economic class has improved slightly, but the advent of IT technology and the social media are making more people informed or misinformed. If the moral and ethical values of the Filipinos have stayed or improved, we will know in the May 2022 election results."
1,"If you want to live long enough to keep doing battle for your choices of president for the next, say, five succeeding presidential elections, at least as far as your mental balance can be a factor in your overall physical health, then try to do at least these two things: Read political commentaries only for information or entertainment, never as sign posts to show the way. And don't get mad or you won't get a good night's sleep. You'll only get madder. For example, if I say that most people have been regarding politicians the wrong way, you do not really have to believe me. It is not I who will suffer from your ignorance. Bwa ha ha. See? I did not mean that as a demeaning and condescending insult. You don't have to get mad at it. You might even learn to laugh with me in celebration of your ignorance. (It's maddening, no, when I use the language of ""yellow"" journalism?). But while you may do as I say and laugh along, I am actually deadly serious about it being a big mistake how most people regard politicians. When people are for a particular politician, they regard him or her as the best, incapable of any wrong. But when they are against a politician, they see him or her as the epitome of everything bad, even as the devil incarnate. The mistake here lies in allowing feeling to take precedence over thinking. This has always been mostly the case. Let us take Bongbong Marcos. He is not only a presidential candidate, he is the main issue in this election. Even his main rival, Leni Robredo, admitted to running on no other platform than to try and prevent the ascendancy of another Marcos to Malacañang. That is pretty hateful (a feeling) to me than clear thinking (knowing her abilities). If people allow themselves to place feelings in the back burner and bring clear thinking to the fore, they will realize that all politicians are really all just the same. They will do whatever it takes to win an election. And as there is no perfect person, each politician is a mix of good and bad, with the prevailing mental picture of him or her dependent on where the people allow their feelings to take them. Those who love Marcos will not listen to what those who hate him have to say. A common answer of the Marcos lovers to the dirty talk of the Marcos haters is ""so?"" or ""so what?"" And this can only drive either side to even greater heights of gleeful mirth or deeper depths of even darker thoughts and rage. Either way no one really ends up the wiser even if one may emerge the eventual winner. Another mistake people make is in thinking of politicians as self-made and self-sufficient individuals we need to elect in order to serve us. But that is forgetting one very crucial element in the equation --the people themselves. People forget it is they who make the politicians. If fact, the extent to which politicians can push their inherent goodness or badness is entirely up to how much the people allow them the slack. In other words, it is who the people are that the politicians eventually become. Politicians are a reflection of the people who elected them. I find it absolutely absurd, therefore, for the Marcos haters to think they are insulated and immune just because they happen to hate him. Wrong. The Marcos haters are as much a part of the problem they imagine themselves seeing. Just look at how Robredo anchors her candidacy, which is to run just because a Marcos is running. What kind of a direction is that for her to take the country to? If she wins, all it means is that Marcos lost. And then what? Can you not see what kind of foolishness that is? If politician A is in because politician B is out, where does that place the country? It is dangerous to vote based on a feeling. People need to know where their leader takes them."
1,"MANILA, Philippines — Taliwas sa katotoha­nan ang naging pahayag ng isang kongresista na hindi sila pinayagang makapagsagawa ng political rally sa Quezon City Memorial Circle (QCMC) bilang pagpapakita ng suporta sa presidential bid ni Bongbong Marcos. Ito ang ipinahayag ni Mayor Joy Belmonte kasabay nang pagsasabing wala silang tinanggihang anumang request mula sa kanyang katunggali na si Rep. Mike Defensor para magsagawa ng rali. Sa katunayan umano, mismong ang QC government pa nga ang nag-alok sa kampo nito na gamitin ang covered gymnasium, na isa sa pinakabagong pasilidad sa QCMC na maaaring makapag-accommodate ng may 3,000 katao na nasusunod ang social distancing. Gayunman,iginiit umano ng kampo ni Defensor na magamit ay ang Liwasang Aurora. Paliwanag ng QC LGU na mahirap makontrol ang dagsa ng tao sa pasilidad sa Liwasang Aurora dahil ito ay bukas sa general public. Sa isang pahayag, binanggit pa ng pamahalaang lungsod na bukas sila sa anumang uri ng rali, events at mga programa ng kahit anong partidong politikal hangga’t sinusunod ng mga organizer nito ang mga panuntunan, regulasyon at mga pamamaraan na mapanatili ang kaayusan sa lugar na nabigyan ng permiso para magamit. Kasabay naman nito, sinabi pa ni Belmonte na kakaklaruhin pa rin nila sa national government ang guidelines sa aktibidades patungkol sa political campaign na posibleng magdulot ng panganib dahil na rin sa nararanasan pang pan­demya ng COVID-19. Nakipagkoordinasyon na rin umano siya sa DILG patungkol dito, kung saan sinabi ng ahensya na ang ganitong mga aktibidad ay hindi pa pinapayagan. Binanggit naman ni City Attorney Orlando Casimiro na maitutu­ring na isang kalokohan lamang ang iniisyung ito kay ­Belmonte ng kanyang mga kalaban. Makakalaban ni ­Mayor Belmonte sa pagka-alkalde sa lungsod si Defensor para sa 2022 elections."
1,"There are times in the lives of Filipinos when they just follow the trend and just go along with the flow of the many. In politics, everywhere else in the Philippines, voters just follow what the mayors and governors put in the sample ballots. But not Cebuanos. They support a good governor and a good mayor, but they choose their own president. Cebuanos are not blind fanatics. I hope other Filipinos are the same. This coming May 2022, is such a time for our countrymen to think for themselves. They should vote not as Cebuanos, Ilocanos, Capampangans, Ilonggos, Warays, or Bicolanos, but as one nation facing tremendous problems. We should think not as loyalists of certain candidates or of some political dynasties. We should think of our nation and its many challenges, from the need to improve our pandemic responses and how to resuscitate the devastated economy to foreign relations, and the protection of our territorial integrity. We need to be mindful of the many pressing concerns, from food security, rising poverty, unemployment to disaster preparedness. We should think of the candidates' competence, character, and their readiness to resolve the problems and bring back hope to a demoralized citizenry. We should reject what our local politicians are carrying as their chosen presidential bets. We should not remain as blind followers who swallow hook, line, and sinker whatever the governor and the mayor tell us. This is about our own destiny as a people. This is about the future of our children, the welfare of our people and the well-being of 112 million Filipinos. This is not about loyalty to our local politicians. We should stand on our own principles, consult our own conscience, and reject the dictates of our local trapos. Governors and mayors receive truckloads of money from presidential candidates, from partylist aspirants, from senatorial bets, and others even from foreign local and foreign investors who have businesses and other vested interests in their provinces, cities, and towns. These local politicians are using the people to amass a lot of money during presidential polls like what we are holding next year. That is why we should reject the candidates they are forcing down our throats, especially those with issues about drugs, tax evasion, incompetence, unexplained wealth, and a history of corruption and vested interests. These local politicians may be good as local government leaders, and they must have excellent track records in public service. We may have to support them for lack of better alternatives. But if they use their own merits in order to promote the political agenda of national candidates who are shady characters and have very bad or questionable track records, we should not follow their imposition. We should think for ourselves and refuse to be herded like meek lambs. We have our own brains, our own conscience, and our own free will. We are not robots or unthinking fanatics. This is about our own country, our own future. At the end of the day, these governors and mayors cannot help us cope with our daily needs. They just throw people a few sardines and some kilos of rice, once in a while, and hand out a few hundreds to buy our votes. But they received truckloads of cash from incompetent but wealthy candidates for presidents and senators. Let us, for once, think for ourselves and refuse to be used."

1,"There is a mad dash to the drawing boards by analysts and political strategists, as well as politicians wanting to chart their own destinies, following the dizzying events of the past few days. Virtually everyone is trying to configure new resolutions to the antics of President Duterte in pushing Senator Bong Go to run for president, and himself for a seat in the Senate. But whatever their political persuasions are, they all seem to be arriving at the same conclusion: That it is the candidacy of Bongbong Marcos for president that will suffer the most from the new electoral configuration. I think they are all headed in the wrong direction with their new assumptions. They are even making the big mistake of projecting a shift in support to Leni Robredo. First off, a caveat. I am no analyst but a plain observer. And even my observations I can neither put into a thesis professionally nor scientifically. In short, these views of mine are simply to be taken for what they are, the views of one ordinary man. That said, let me go off in the exact opposite direction. And I dare say it is Bongbong who will benefit the most from the disarray of this fray. Let me start off with a question. Why was Bongbong, among all the candidates, the only one who was willing to go it alone even from the beginning? He did not have a sure vice president. It was only last Saturday that Sara Duterte filed for vice president for her to be adopted by Bongbong. He did not have a Senate slate. He did not even have the original party of his father, the KBL. Yet he decided to run despite these formidable drawbacks. Why? Because among all candidates, Bongbong alone has a bailiwick, a base of support that is as unwavering as its name -- the Solid North. He also has a large portion of Eastern Visayas that is just as solid and unwavering. Taken together, I would imagine these to translate into at least five to six million votes sewn up inside his pants pocket. No way they can be picked. The rest of the votes are a toss-up for everyone, including Bongbong himself. In other words, he can only add to his sewn up support. What the analysts say will go to Leni or whoever have never been Bongbong's in the first place. That is the first elephant in the room. Bongbong's bailiwicks. While everyone has to scramble for all the uncommitted votes, he can only add to the five or six million that are already his. Let me give an insight. Cebu, with all its cities and towns, has a voting population of 3.2 million, making it the most vote-rich in the country. Cebu is also known for being opposition. Read that as anti-Marcos. Yet an ongoing online survey started in October by Sugbo.ph had, as this was written, Leni and Bongbong statistically tied at 47 percent. It is Bongbong who is eating away at what should have been Leni's advantage in Cebu. Now to the other elephant in the room. Bongbong as a Marcos is already at rock bottom. Everything bad, evil, sinister has been ascribed to him or his name. His enemies want him disqualified. But what government with an eye to the general peace and welfare would disqualify a candidate who leads in most surveys over something that is not only not new but tame compared to the other accusations thrown in his direction? When you are at rock bottom, the only way to go is up. And there is, I think, a third elephant in the room. I think Filipinos, with all their imperfections, are still genuinely Christian at heart. That after beating up the Marcoses to a pulp and leaving them half dead, with bishops even joining the carnage, the inherent Christian kindness will eventually kick in. Enough is enough. There will be, in the end, a human sympathy vote out there waiting for BBM."
1,"The power broker of the grand conspiracy between the Solid North and the Liquid South (liquid because of loads of campaign money) was the brainchild of no less than GMA, one of the most well-known political operators in Philippine history, a historical character associated always in the mind with the infamous phrase “Hello, Garci?” There, the Pact of Balesin was consummated, not unlike the Pact of Biak na Bato, which compromised the principles of Andres Bonifacio. Mayor Inday Sara, the crown princess of the Kingdom of the South, had to fly to that multi-million dollar resort owned by Jaime Ongpin, a billionaire and former Marcos Cabinet member. Then, she resigned from Hugpong, a party she herself founded. The resignation was handwritten hurriedly in a resort letterhead. Forthwith, she attended that grand wedding in Cavite to stand as principal sponsor in the wedding of the year of senator Bong Revilla's daughter. Who was her co-sponsor? Lo and behold, the lord of the North, Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos Jr, marching in the aisle with the crown princess from the south. And immediately from the nuptial, the jet-setting mayor proceeded to take her oath as a new member of the party whose president, Martin Romualdez, is the first cousin of Bongbong Marcos. How easy and how fast can party membership be changed. Then, the next day, the certificate of candidacy for vice president was filed with the Comelec. A few hours thereafter, the party of Marcos announced that it has passed a resolution adopting Inday Sara as their vice presidential candidate. How fast, how convenient, and how easy. How flawless with which they followed the script. Do these political schemers think that the people are stupid enough not to discern that they are taken in for a ride? These quick alliances are not for any noble purpose but to perpetuate the powers in the hands of these lords. They are afraid that the opposition (and there is only one genuine opposition, by the way) may snatch a victory from behind. What should alarm all the people is that this grand alliance of dynasties is the coming together of the Marcos Dynasty of the North, the Macapagal-Arroyo Dynasty of Central Luzon, the Romualdez Dynasty of Eastern Visayas, and the Duterte Dynasty of southern Mindanao. This alliance has the support of the multi-billionaire Villars of Las Pinas, the Gatchalians from Valenzuela, the Cayetanos from Taguig. They have the support of Chavit Singson, the kingpin of Ilocos Sur, and the political lords of Isabela, the Dys, and the many loyal earls and dukes of Pangasinan, Nueva Ecija, Bulacan and other provinces nearby. If the Garcias, the Duranos, the Ouanos, the Gullases and the Radazas shall join in this grand cartel of aristocrats, then the people should stand up as one, they should unite and assert their freedom from the tentacles of oligarchs and political lords. Who then will defend the poor people from the schemes and machinations of the rich and the powerful? Not Ping Lacson, not Isko Moreno, not even Manny Pacquiao. Only a woman will fight against all of them, a widow without money, without machinery but with the faith, the trust and the votes of the long oppressed but now awakened people. When all else shall have fallen, only Leni shall prevail. The new Joan of Arc, the new Gabriela Silang, the new Princess Urduja. And the people will be with her."
1,"These second rate trying hard copycat trapos should give the nation a break. They are making a mockery of our electoral process, and are playing a political rigodon de bola-bola or zarzuela de bugal-bugal. They are supposed to be national leaders and models of respectable behavior of decent, honorable men and women of probity, decorum, and civility. What we are seeing is a spectacle of greed for power, displayed in its most despicable incongruities. The people deserve a little respect from their so-called leaders, and they should be spared from these obnoxious aberrations emanating from some political dynasties which have no other visible means of livelihood but politics ad nauseam. In the recent weeks, we saw a city mayor filing a certificate of candidacy for reelection and telling the people that she has no ambition for national office, only to take back her words, in a matter of days thereafter, and run for vice president. What exacerbated the charade was that the younger brother had to replace her as if this family had a Torrens title to the city hall. We also saw that same lady attending a wedding as principal sponsor to the daughter of a senator who had just been exonerated by the court on charges of plunder connected with the Napoles  scandal. That lady was playing coy walking, with demure smiles, in the aisle with her presidential candidate, as co-principal sponsor, surrounded by a crowd of trapos and believers of transactional politics. Then wearing the same gown, that lady proceeded directly to the office of the president of another political party, to take her oath for convenience, of course, so that she could have a launching pad to run for vice president. And in a matter of few minutes, the party of the presidential candidate from the north adopted her as its vice presidential team mate. What a spectacle, what a travesty. Do these trapos ever believe that the people are still stupid enough to take these charades as integral parts of a corrupt political system? Maybe yes, maybe no. But next time, they should write a better script and they should hire more brilliant scriptwriters. If they want to fool the people, they should be more refined and more savvy. Fooling the people should be elevated to a higher form of art, rather than that crude, reckless, if whimsical and grossly insulting sort of trash. Their slips are showing and their pantomimes are getting shallower and shallower by the day. If they are bent at playing this kind of game, they should at least try a little form of dignified atrocity. And because of money, political machinery, and the combined support of all the country's  major dynasties, this lady may become the next vice president of the republic. And if her president is dislodged from the presidency, because of a serious petition to cancel his certificate of candidacy, then another mayor from the same southern city may become the third female president of our country. And if that happens, may God have mercy on all of us."
1,"After the recent withdrawal of a known politician in Mindanao from a reelection bid as mayor, the internet became an instant battleground for netizen’s comments. One netizen said, “Pretending to be shocked,” while another said, “As if naman di pa naming alam, eh, ginawa nay an ng tatay mo.” On the other hand, others came to the defense of the politician, saying: “Hurot gyud ang paracetamol ron kay daghan na naglabad ang ulo.”"
1,"We have to be wary of this common tendency of ours. We are always prone to show externally what we actually are not internally. We easily fall into some kind of political or social correctness without the proper spirit animating it. We easily fall into forms of legalism and formalism. Often, we just want to see things around out of idle curiosity and be seen and appreciated by others out of vanity. We fail to connect the material to the spirit, the little things with the big, essential things, etc. All these were somehow bewailed by Christ. “Woe to you Pharisees! You pay tithes of mint and of rue and of every garden herb, but you pay no attention to judgment and to love for God. These you should have done, without overlooking the others. Woe to you Pharisees! You love the seat of honor in synagogues and greetings in marketplaces. Woe to you! You are like unseen graves over which people unknowingly walk.” (Lk 11,42-44) We should always be on guard against all these forms of inconsistency, always rectifying our intentions and also regularly editing our life, much like what writers do with their work before they are submitted for publication. That way, we can monitor how things are going and can have the chance to make appropriate corrections, improvements, revisions, etc. In anything that we do, let’s see to it that our intentions are pure. That is to say, that we have to be motivated always by love for God and neighbor. And by love, we mean that we follow God’s commandments as clearly articulated by Christ himself: “If you love me, keep my commandments.” (Jn 14,15) And the epitome of this obedience to God’s commandments is Christ himself, who said: “I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but to do the will of him who sent me.” (Jn 6,38) The secret therefore of love, which is obeying God’s will, is to have the mind and heart of Christ. That is to say, to be ‘another Christ’ which we can always attain because Christ himself has given us all the means. We should be most careful because nowadays it is now easy to stray from God’s commandments and feel convinced that we are still okay. With our man-made laws that are supposed to reflect the spirit of God’s will and ways but often fail, at least partially if not completely, it is now easy for us to hide and justify such anomalies as greed, pride, vanity, envy, corruption, etc. We have to learn how to do a lot of good while passing unnoticed. Also, while it’s true that we have to take care of the little things in our life, we should not forget that we are not meant to get detained there. We should always relate the little ordinary things in our life to the big and ultimate purpose of our life. Christ himself somehow referred to this point when he said, “Whoever is faithful with very little will also be faithful with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.” (Lk 16,10) With those words, Christ somehow was relating and connecting the little with the big things in life. That is what we should always do. We should avoid getting entangled and lost in the little things and forgetting the big and more important things in our life."
1,"COVID-19 can make and unmake presidents, prime ministers, political parties, and governments. Make no bones about these. The multiple deaths arising from the pandemic is emerging as a top political issue in any country these days. And in the Philippines, this pandemic will largely determine the outcome of the 2022 presidential and local elections. Dying from COVID-19 is making many businesses flounder, while a few are making bundles of money, some in conspiracy with corrupt government agencies and public officials. Dying directly impacts the economy and can either devastate or cause booms in the financial fortunes of certain companies. While the cost of living has increased by geometric proportions, the cost of dying has brought about the financial boom of HMOs, hospitals, funeral parlors, crematoriums, and expensive memorial parks and burial grounds. Of course, the lockdowns caused the devastation of many businesses, especially the airlines and the hotel industries. The present administration should remember that one of the driving forces causing the political debacle of a well-entrenched incumbent Republican, Donald Trump, was his rather nonchalant response to the health crisis. His opponent was not really a very strong Democratic challenger in the caliber of John F. Kennedy or the charisma of both Clinton and Obama. He is a bland and monotonous speaker without the usual fire in the belly. But Trump lost not because of the strength of his challenger but due to the weakness of his own health coping strategies. Ditto to the Duterte's government. Secretary Duque is Duterte's heaviest political liability. If I may say so, the manner by which Cebu governor Gwen Garcia handled the local COVID-19 response is evidently superior in speed and accuracy than the national health coping strategies. Governor Gwen did not allow herself to become captive by the varying opinions of medical professionals. Of course, she believed in science but she has also kept the economy and the business at the top of her mind. Our governor did not allow herself to be bullied by pseudo-experts from imperialistic Manila. She stood her ground and that is leadership for you. Ace Durano, whose face was never seen for more than 18 months of the pandemic, does not have the moral right to criticize or claim superiority of responses. Cebu is number one in financial resources among the 82 provinces in the whole nation. Those who never helped should keep their mouths shut. Let their actions speak, and not their talks to claim superiority over concrete actions and solid accomplishments. In Cebu, we were able to glide over the health crisis, saving lives and public health, even as we were able to save jobs, livelihoods and the sources of the people’s living. While the national health response was slow because the president created too many layers of decision-making, the province of Cebu has one dragon lady, decisive, dynamic, and courageous. Her hands were on the deck. She was awake while all the politicians were enjoying their sleep. She is one of the few LGU leaders who kept the equilibrium between health and economy. Governor Gwen understands the politics and economics of the health crisis. Her critics are just babbling words but they were not the ones inside the arena, wounded and scarred but keeping the province on top. The lady governor, of course, made some rash moves, but when proven wrong, she corrected them immediately. She listens to presentations and arguments. But at the end of the day, she calls the shots and makes the decisions. And she stands by her words. That is the mark of a true leader. That is what we lack at the national level."
1,"Political candidates can be seen visiting various locales and meeting ordinary people as early as this time to project a relatable image. Why not, after all? Ordinary citizens make up a sizable portion of the voting population, and they have the potential to make or break a somebody's political ambitions. However, one thing that all of these politicians have in common is the promise they make throughout election season. It's a kind of promise as ethereal and unattainable as the stars and moon. For many, the promise remains just that: a dream. What is extremely disappointing and aggravating is when they offer specific information such as the number of months or years it would take to cure our maladies, as if all of our problems will be solved soon. However, their time has come to an end, and their promises have yet to be fulfilled. This is the scene that keeps repeating itself. We're sick of hearing the same lies over and over again. And yet, if they had the courage, several of these politicians would want to run for office again. Is this because they think we're gullible and have a short memory? Can we still be duped by the same charade of deception? Politics is the subtle art of enticing the poor to vote and the wealthy to donate to campaigns by promising to protect each other. The rich's privileged status and the poor's disadvantaged position are perpetuated by this recurring cycle. In this crucial exercise of our right, we must constantly remember that everything a politician promises during an election must be paid for either by greater taxes or borrowing. Rest assured that these politicians, particularly at the national level, are considering this option in order to keep their commitments. Who would bear the brunt of the high taxes and increasing international debts if not the citizens themselves? Promises, like wailing babies at a movie, should be kept right away. So, if we've had similar experiences before, there's no reason why we can't learn from them now. A present promise foreshadows the sorrow that our generation will face in the future. Politicians promise us heaven before an election and then deliver hell. Even if they are as far away as the stars and moon, they will continue to vow to build bridges even if there are no rivers. The only thing politicians are offering is the delivery of a broken promise since promises have become techniques to obtain what they want rather than commitments that they aim to keep. And when and how will we be able to escape this cycle? The solution is right in front us. Sadly, we just refuse to accept the problem and take action. But don't be misled by the lamb's meekness; it's simply the front end of a venomous snake."
1,"Politics all over the world, and since people starting living in societies, is never known for adhering to good moral and ethical standards. From the earliest records of human history, we learned of the immoral and amoral actions of politicians in lying, rigging, manipulating, coercing and even killing just to get and/or stay in power. From the Bible, the travails of King David and Solomon up to the demise of the Twelve Tribes of David, are full of these shenanigans. The stories about the Roman Empire with the treachery of Brutus and the ensuing wars and the fall of the empire are classic examples. From the 10th century up to now, we see the same political maneuverings that also led to the downfall of societies and countries. All the revolutions, from the French Revolution, the American Revolution, the Russian Revolution, the Chinese Revolution, the Philippine’s People Power, the ongoing Myanmar revolt, and the many civil unrest/demonstrations in Brazil, Venezuela, Haiti, Lebanon, and some African countries, are consequences of politicians exceeding/breaking the line of political decency. The line or limit of political decency is actually the moral/ethical line that all religions teach and propagate to all their adherents. It is in the 10 Commandments, the teachings of Buddha, Confucius, Mohammed, and other religions. These guidelines and teachings are primary ingredients for the orderly functioning and progress of society, because without these rules, people would be encroaching on each other territories and prerogatives. Basically, it is about justice and from where truth and respect for other rights follow. Over the years, politicians have been pushing these limits, stretching them as far as possible, and some breaking beyond the limits. The consequences to them are losing in elections, getting deposed by revolutions, and infamy in history. To the people and the societies, it leads to a failed state unable to function and provide services to the governed. A proximate example of these are the Marcos years in the Philippines and its aftermath, and the Mamasapano Massacre in Mindanao. These were major disasters for the Filipino people and the Philippines. The Philippines is seven months from the May 2022 elections and we can see that politicians are pushing the limits of political decency. Duterte, like many of the populist politicians in other countries, has been stretching this decency limit by their personal and political actions. Unsavory speeches, uncouth behavior, and coercion are publicly displayed. Political actions bordering on illegality and unconstitutionality are pushed. Blatant graft and corruption are tolerated and defended which are abhorrent and even “cringe worthy” to their loyal followers. And more seem to be coming, like the peddling of fake news, revising history, blatant money politicking and influencing with government resources. Historically and globally the line or limit of political decency has not moved, as civilizations have come and gone, because the moral and ethical bases are firmly anchored on the survival of society and a way of life. It is also buttressed by various religions and faiths. Politicians push, stretch, breach, and break the limits, but it is always pushed back by the people. Or rebuilt by the people after an election or revolution. The ongoing campaign and the coming Philippine election will be a test of the strength of these “political line of decency” and what it will take to rebuild them. A well-known politician, who happens to be my uncle, candidly said that politics is a game of the devils and not of the angels. But it is always the many good people with the angels who will hold and rebuild the line for God and country."
1,"The phrase “great days of the Senate” brings nostalgia to some people. Men and women of unassailable integrity, legal luminaries and patriots, fearless advocates, and towering figures in their respective fields once populated the Senate. The Senate in recent decades has turned into a joke. Not every senator, of course, is a joke. Many Senate investigations in aid of legislation have been replaced with investigations in aid of reelection or sheer political vendetta. Some principles, if not all, are gone. Look at the chopsuey Senate slates under the different presidential candidates. Leni’s group is noticeable, especially that she changed color from yellow to pink. She said that pink is the universal color of protest. We know that there is a deeper reason for leaving yellow. True, it is not a surprise that politicians, driven by instinct for survival, join forces. That Jejomar Binay and Sonny Trillanes are now in one group highlights that scenario in a way that gives the word pragmatism a whole new dimension. Both were not just ordinary foes. They were bitter foes. Together with other senators and masterminded by the Roxas camp, Trillanes helped paint the picture that Binay was the most corrupt politician to have ever walked the earth. Destroyed and unable to recover from the attack, Binay lost miserably in the 2016 presidential election. Their being together in the same slate also produces another irony; Leni positions herself as a clean candidate, crusading against corruption. The ordinary man in the street immediately sees the contradiction by looking at the Senate slate. Leni’s narrative is affected, though depending on how one sees it. What also does not escape the attention of many is the presence of senators Richard Gordon, Leila Delima, and Joel Villanueva, as well as other candidates who have an axe to grind against each other. In fairness to Leni, the politics of accommodation is not exclusive to her. Pacquiao, who said he will jail all corrupt politicians, has Binay in his slate. We’ll never know that one of these days Binay may be in the slate of every presidentiable. That will complete the comedy --or tragedy! Let me be clear: I’m not saying that Binay is corrupt. I’m saying that they who profess to be anti-corruption, like Trillanes who accused Binay of corruption, lose any shred of credibility the moment they eat their words. There is a lesson to learn here, especially for people who witness bitter political fights at the local level; nothing is permanent in politics. Never put great friendship below sheer political partisanship, never sacrifice blood relations on the altar of blind loyalty. Why? Political passions come and go, politicians unite and reunite at whim, for survival is the name of the game. They party all night in the name of unity for convenience. What is seen in the aftermath? Broken friendships among supporters and neighbors that may never see a day of healing. Relatives, whether by blood or not, bring to their graves their grudges against each other, all because of politics. Fight for what you believe in. Fight for your candidates, but know the limits. And on the presidentiables, none of them should, of course, escape scrutiny, not just on their choices of senatorial candidates but also on the issues hurled against them. Bongbong should categorically answer the questions regarding the reign of his father. A mere “I do not know” will not suffice. Isko must prove his readiness, a question which can hit Pacquiao very hard. Lacson, for his part, may answer on questions of human rights violations during his days as a policeman. Bato, whether he likes it or not, has an issue of seriousness, given the fact of possible substitution."
1,"The volatility and unpredictability of Philippine politics is always a given and I have mentioned this in an earlier column, but the abruptness and speed of the social and political developments last week was mind boggling. The trigger was the one week time to file the Certificates of Candidacy by the aspirants for the different elective positions for the May 2022 elections. But the government performance in the last five and a half years, their response to the ongoing pandemic, the economic recession, and the posturings and overt values of the politicians, were/are the underlying causes of the extreme volatility of the political sentiments of the people. There was excitement in the filing of the candidacies for president by Lacson, Pacquiao, and Moreno, but the high drama happened when Robredo finally declared to run for president and filed her certificate the following day, and the subsequent filing of Dela Rosa. The tremendous positive reception of the Robredo candidacy was a game changer that needed a countermove by the Duterte camp in the possible substitution of Sara Duterte in place of Dela Rosa, before the November 15 deadline. It also drew a knee-jerk reaction from Moreno which confirmed his pro-Duterte/Marcos leanings. The Pacquiao and Lacson camp are holding their horses unable to decide on a response that will not be damaging to their candidates. While the images appearing in Metro Manila, like whole buildings awash in pink, spontaneous posters, and people congratulating each other may be viewed as Manila-centric, the postings in the main and social media are also dominantly pro-Robredo and these are all over the country. The election is still seven months away and many things may still happen including Sara running for president, even if this has already been denied by herself and the president last Saturday. Still the events last week were a giant step for the Robredo camp and maybe for the Filipino people. The Pharmally overpricing medical supply scandal could not have come at the worst time for the administration candidates, as the Duterte term is coming to an end and in their desire to stay in power. Government satisfaction and their potential candidates’ ratings are going down. The aggressive defense of Duterte of Pharmally and involved Cabinet officials, the attacks on the Senate, and the funny maneuvers of some congressmen on the witnesses are bullying tactics and overkill that are unacceptable to even minimally-decent people. It’s creating a backlash and blowback that is probably costing the administration candidates some seven million votes. Some people believe the Duterte camp has a grand strategy to stay in power with all the maneuvers that the Cusi/PDP-Laban are doing, including a Duterte-Marcos tandem. While this is still a possibility up to November 15, this is ""gaming"" the system and a desperation move that will only fuel further resentment of this administration. From the erratic and illogical tactics like antagonizing the Pacquiao/Pimentel camp and the mixed messaging from the Duterte camp, it does not look like they have the algorithm for their plans. The Robredo surge may be explainable if we do a sector analysis of the voting population, given the current conditions in these sectors. The wanting pandemic response of the government will have the doctors, nurses, and medical people tilt to the opposition, the economic recession and the devastation of the SMSEs have pushed business sector also to the opposition. The high unemployment and the chaotic education policies will also tilt the labor and education sector to the opposition. Then, the agriculture sector is unhappy about the rice and pork importation that are compounding their problems. The public denouncements of the Philippine Bar Association, the PICPA accountants, the Makati Business Club, the Philippine Chamber of Commerce, and Catholic/Christian churches on the power overreach by this government, also show a lot of sympathy for the opposition. People Power is not necessarily about revolution, it is about people reclaiming their right to have their voice heard by the government officials and the government. In the past five years people have been afraid to speak up and voice their opinion. Recent and future events will show that people value their freedoms and liberties, and will reclaim their power to have a hand in their destiny. This is happening in Venezuela, Brazil, Myanmar, Turkey, and some countries in Eastern Europe and Africa. There are also upcoming elections in some of these countries. Hopefully, one of these countries or the Philippines will set a good example of the peaceful return of a responsive and democratic government again."
1,"And not only habit-forming but contagious, transmissible and seemingly hereditary. There are families whose patriarchs and scions are so fixated and addicted to politics that they never seem to have any other visible means of livelihood but politics. They eat politics for breakfast, lunch and dinner and a lot of meriendas or more in between. They do not practice their professions nor engage in decent businesses but make politics their bread and butter. The only famous politicians in history who did not push their children to go into politics were General Emilio Aguinaldo, Manuel L Quezon and Carlos P Garcia. All the rest had made politics their alpha and omega, their ends and their means. The Osmeñas were politicians since Don Sergio Osmeña Sr was elected Cebu governor in 1906 at the age of 28. His son Serging was a consummate politician, albeit he failed to win over Marcos in 1969. Serging's sons, Serge and Tom, became politicians, and I do not know of anything else that they did. Until now, or 115 years since 1906, the Osmeñas are still hooked into this human malady. And this is bound to be transmitted to the children and grandchildren of Tom and Serge. The Ramas, and there are also a number of them, aside from Vice Mayor Mike, have never stopped since Don Vicente Rama was elected councilor in 1916 or 105 years ago. The Cuencos also are still at it or for more than 109 years ago since Don Mariano Jesus Cuenco became an assemblyman representing southern Cebu's fifth district from Boljoon in the southeast to Alcantara in the southwest. The Duranos had been in control of Danao and the old first district, now the fifth, since Mano Amon Mercado Durano, the grandfather of Ace, since Ramon Durano Sr became mayor of Danao in 1955. Ace is the son of Ramon Durano III, and their politics may extend beyond Ramon Durano XIII or way beyond. The Garcias are in the height of their political supremacy for the longest time, too, since the late Noy Pabling Garcia became councilor of Dumanjug in 1951 or 70 years ago. Governor Gwen, Congressman Pablo John and a number of other Garcias, including Christina Garcia-Frasco, mayor of Liloan, are bound to stay many generations forward. Incoming vice mayor (if he wins) Raymond Garcia will follow his dad, Alvin, a son of Noy Jesus, founder of another paper. The Gullases also started not in 1969 when Eddiegul became a congressman of the old third district. They started when the founder of The FREEMAN, the bar topnotcher, Atty Paul Gullas, became a congressman in 1925. Mayor Samsam and his great grandchildren will most probably continue this tradition until kingdom come. Well, like viruses, politics has too many variants, and they are bound to spread like a pandemic from Ilocos to Tawi-Tawi. In the Philippines, and all the nooks and crannies of this crazy world. Politics has infected humanity since Cain murdered Abel and since the 12 tribes of Israel battled against one another for power, possessions, and prestige. It's still the same old story. Like the song goes, the fight for love and glory and politics, ad nauseam, till the end of time."
1,"While waiting for a couple of big bangs widely expected to rock the national political scene but which appear to be taking their own sweet time to happen, let us go back to a local issue in Cebu whose own resolution ought to have long arrived but which has instead dragged because of the main protagonists' intransigence in not doing what is correct, moral, and fair as demanded of leaders by their constituents. I am talking about the multi-billion-peso reclamation project in Consolacion that the son-and-mother municipal leadership appears bent on ramming through despite growing multi-sectoral protests, incontrovertible threats to the environment as warned by experts, among them Dr. Filipinas Sotto, hard economic dislocation of affected businesses and tragic loss of jobs and livelihood by hapless residents already reeling from the pandemic. For months now, Mayor Joannes Alegado and his mother Vice Mayor Teresa Alegado have been pushing a 200-hectare-plus reclamation project in partnership with a private consortium that is being dubbed Seafront City and envisioned to bring economic boon to the municipality. All things being equal, maybe it will and maybe it will not. What is certain is that a huge price will have to be paid by those standing in the way of big development. Compassion and humaneness ought never to be divorced from leadership. In fact, in tandem with vision and resolve, compassion and humaneness ought to be leadership's hallmarks. They ought to be the vanguard ensuring leadership success. Any pretender to leadership devoid of such qualities are pygmies on the stage and do not deserve the lofty places they arrogate unto themselves, and for which they demand obedience and respect. What is unsettling is that instead of facing the issues squarely, the Consolacion town leadership would rather resort to the devious and hackneyed trick of ascribing ill motives on those opposed to the project on legitimate grounds. According to the Alegados, those seeking to block the project have vested interests in their opposition and are only out to discredit the local government. The Alegados apparently wear only rose-tinted glasses. I wonder if they can hear their own selves talking. But as any casual observer will tell you, it is those aggressively pushing the project despite the clear disadvantages, tragic losses, and potentially destructive consequences who can only have any vested interests in the project. Without vested interests, any leader with a heart will immediately forego any promise of gain in favor of living and breathing human lives that are in peril of being lost. But how has the leadership of Consolacion invested itself in the interest of its living and breathing constituents? Sad to say it does not have a very proud record to display. Even without dredging for historical evidence of neglect and skewed priorities, just a few days of rain and floods already tell volumes of failure by that leadership to put its priorities in order. Rains do not ambush mankind. They come usually on time. There is such a thing as a science to climate. Good leaders know what to expect and act accordingly. But if the Consolacion leadership, after years of being at the helm, still cannot solve the much simpler problem of flooding, how can anyone trust their word on a reclamation project that has even more worrisome portents of destruction than just a dark cloud presaging rain? Flooding is an environmental problem, just as are the many other problems enumerated by the many experts who have lent their voices to those opposed to the reclamation project. It now appears that the Consolacion leadership is not so hot on the environment. It appears that there are other priorities to which its attention is geared. It seems its interest is invested somewhere else. And it takes no expert to know where."
1,"MANILA, Philippines — Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte assured residents that politics does not play a role in the declaration of special concern lockdowns (SCLs) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. “The lockdown is not a political act. It’s a decision of our city epidemiology and surveillance unit (CESU),” she said in an interview with “The Chiefs” on Cignal TV’s One News on Wednesday night. “Here in Quezon City, the people can be assured that lockdowns are all purely medical interventions to prevent COVID-19,” she added. Belmonte noted that politicians do not interfere with the decisions of the local health officials, saying she does not even sign the letter informing the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases. “I assign the city administrator to do it because I do not want to be involved in anything that has to do with the lockdown, to prevent any speculations that this might be something that is political,” she added. The mayor was responding to a question on the possibility that lockdowns may be used to prevent voters from taking part in next year’s elections. According to her, the city has clear policies and guidelines to prevent this from happening. Last month, she issued new guidelines on the pilot implementation of Alert Levels in the city, which included details on how the SCL system would be implemented. “The city may implement SCLs not only when vital to contain COVID-19 outbreaks, but also when preemptively necessary in areas with high risk of disease transmission due to widespread health protocol violations and other relevant factors,” it read. “The city government, in coordination with the barangay concerned, shall determine the precise area covered by each SCL on a case-to-case basis,” it added. Forty-seven areas in Quezon City are currently under SCL, which is seen as an effective measure to prevent further transmission of the virus. It covers only specific areas within communities and not entire barangays. All residents in areas under lockdown undergo swab testing, with the city government providing food packs and other essential kits."
1,"The filing for the certificates of candidacy has just started in all the Comelec offices across the country. The preparations have already been laid out considering the ""new normal"" where people have to distance themselves from one another and only a limited number of individuals are allowed in. That being said, there is already no stopping the elections that are set to happen next year. It will be the time when our country will experience a turning point in its governance. Who will reign supreme? The administration whose track record is known for the promise of eradicating drugs and crime within the first six months or a newcomer to the field? But to tell you frankly, it is still so hard to read the political climate as of today. I also felt the same during the same period for the 2016 presidential elections. However, I could say that at that time, the choices were diverse and we already knew the people who were stepping up to the game. Today it is a different landscape where even newbies in politics are trying their hand at the presidency. The names that we hear today are pretty obvious. I guess this is because they want to follow the footsteps of the president today who was the mayor of Davao City. This shifted their mindset that anyone could rise up to the highest position. But that was a totally different story, if you ask me. Now they are also banking on his political party to get the seats that they want. They have created factions within themselves which translates to the inadequate ability to foster harmony among each another. They couldn't even agree among themselves who should go after the big shoes that need to be filled. All of them have their own agenda in mind. That's how politics is today. Gone are the intentions to bring the country into a better light but the only intentions left are theirs alone. The aspirants have become so engrossed in making sure they get the perfect slate with the right support to secure their victory. Then what? Our lives will go on in misery, or not. This is how sad Philippine politics is. Don't get me wrong. I have a few friends who are holding esteemed positions and I respect them for that. However, when it comes to the polls, we just see that it becomes a circus-like race. Aspirants take hold of anyone that they can take advantage of to further propel them into popularity. I think the bottom line now is for every one of us to be careful in the next days to come. We will be seeing a lot of political ads, content, videos, and posters. The question is if we allow these forms of media to be consumed by us and how we are going to process it. It is a frenzy, a series of some sort that could either be entertaining or beneficial to us."
1,"We are a small and poor country pretending to act like a superpower. We have too many congressmen with an excess of deputy speakers. And any Tomas, Dikoy, or Harry can create his own political party, as easy as organizing a birthday party. The United States, with 50 states and a total voting population of 168.31 million, only has two political parties of note, the Democrats and the Republicans. The United Kingdom, with 1,439 electoral constituencies and 47.6 million voters, only has two political parties; the Conservative and the Labor Party. The Philippines have five political parties in the Senate and 10 in the Lower House. There are many party-lists and many national and regional political parties. There is no clear ideology, no defined principles. Just a party party. We have the potential to be entered the Guiness Books of Records as the country with the most number of political parties. The biggest is the most beleaguered by intra-union dispute, the PDP-Laban. As of today, the faction of Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi is led by President Rodrigo Duterte as National Chairman. The Pacquiao faction is led by Senator Coco Pimentel as party chairman. It has five members in the Senate out of 24, and 62 members in the House out of 304. The PDP-Laban was founded on the ideology of democratic socialism and federalism. The Nacionalista Party, founded on conservatism, is led by Manuel and Cynthia Villar and has five members in the Senate and 42 in the House. How the NP went to the Villars is another story for the books. The NPC or Nationalist People's Coalition, led by Senate President Tito Sotto III believes in liberal conservatism. It has three senators and 33 congressmen. The Lakas-CMD led by Congressman Martin Romualdez is founded on Christian and Muslim democracy has one senator and 19 congressmen. The Liberal Party, founded on liberalism and led by Senator Kiko Pangilinan, has three senators and 17 congressmen. The LDP or Lakas Ng Demokratikong Pilipino is led by Senator Sonny Angara. Its ideology is fiscal conservatism. It has one senator and two congressmen. The Akbayan party-list, led by Senator Risa Hontiveros, only has one senator and no member in Congress. It is founded on democratic socialism and progressivism. The UNA or United Nationalist Alliance, led by Senator Nancy Binay has only one senator and no congressman. Its ideology is rightist libertarianism. The Bagumbayan, led by Senator Richard Gordon has one senator and no congressman. It is founded on voluntarism. The NUP or National Unity Party, led by Congressman Elpidio Barzaga of Cavite has 45 congressmen and no senator. The PMP or Pwersa Ng Masang Pilipino of Joseph Estrada has no senator and one congressman. The Aksyon Demokratiko of the late senator Raul Roco is now being led by Isko Moreno. It has only one congressman. The same is true with the late senator Miriam Defensor Santiago's Peoples' Reform Party, now led by her husband Narciso. From the time President Ferdinand Marcos abolished the two-party system, after the declaration of martial law, party politics in the Philippines has become a free-for-all pintakasi, where everyone and any Tomas, Dikoy, or Harry can create any party under the mango tree. This is not even counting the regional and provincial parties like Hugpong and our own Bakud, Kusug, Barug, and One Cebu. We are becoming the laughing stock again in this part of the world, as another banana republic with an excess of political varieties, like a kare-kare. Politicians are like viruses creating too many variants. We have deteriorated to a level next to reckless multiplication preparatory to ultimate extinction. Shame, shame, shame."

Umabot na kay Dracula, baka mamaya maging Fran­kenstein na or Egyptian mummy. Ewan ko ba, dati bentang-benta ‘pag nagbibitaw ng mga ganu’ng dialogue si Papa Digong, pero lately parang ang mga oneliner niya wala nang premium, hindi na kinakagat. Napanood ko minsan sa TV na naging speaker siya, wala na ‘yung sigla ng audience nang magbitaw siya ng biro tungkol sa spare tires. Samantalang noong araw, basta nagsalita si Papa Digong wait ka sa mga oneliner, now parang waley na sa tao. Para bang ‘yung jokes na binibitawan niya you find it in bad taste now. Actually nga, habang binibira niya si Sen. Gordon parang gusto mo nang iboto ito dahil feeling mo binu-bully na. Siguro nakita iyon ni Cong. Lucy kaya natakot tumakbo sa Senado. Imagine mo, Presidente, ganun ang sinasabi sa isang senador? Nasaan na ang respeto para sa ating mga high ranking officials at leaders? Parang mga ordinaryo na silang mga tao na hindi mo bibigyang galang. A big joke para sa lahat ng Pilipino. Mas gusto ko na siguro ‘yung dati, parang mga demigod ang ating officials. Ginagalang. Hindi sisipsipin ni Dracula ang dugo. Trip to Baguio nina Paolo at Yen, naging katatawanan na rin Siguro happy sina Sec. Berna Romulo Puyat at Mayor Benjamin Magalong ng Baguio sa title na Friendship Capital of the Philippines, Salve. Naging byword at hashtag na talaga ito sa lahat, hah hah. Kahit na may naughty connotation ‘pag sinasabi na halika sa Baguio, usap tayo friend, malaking impact din ang ibinibigay nito para sa Summer Capital. Ok din na nakatulong sina Paolo Contis at Yen Santos sa tourism industry. Mahirap iyon kay LJ Reyes dahil masyadong mahal ang ticket papuntang New York, ganda rin sana i-promote na ‘gusto mo gamutin heartache punta ka New York’ eh may visa pa, plane fare at accommodation expenses ang mae-encounter mo.

1,"The early findings of the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee, chaired by Senator Richard Gordon, in its hearing last Tuesday, on the multi-billion peso expense by the Department of Health seemed too shocking that I hope President Rodrigo Duterte, Secretary Harry Roque, and other brilliant spinners can find some explanation to mitigate the damning impact. Among the horrors that I am still trying to cope with was the information that Senator Franklin Drilon’s questioning uncovered. I fear that should I write about my perception on it in this column, the unraveling data might add to the anger of our countrymen as to push them into action far more historic than the so-called EDSA Revolution because, to me, the kind of plunder apparently committed by this administration of President Duterte seems unprecedented in its inventiveness and unparalleled in its enormity. True to the off-tangent nature of this column, however, let me veer from the nauseating findings of the Senate investigation towards a more imaginative topic --three as a number. Three is the number of harmony, wisdom, and understanding. In time, we mention three scenes namely past, present, and future. Or birth, life and death. A great speech has three parts; the beginning, the middle, and the end. In the Olympic Games only three are awarded medals; gold, silver, and bronze. There were three less earth-shaking events that took place the other day. Number 1 was the President Duterte’s “talk to the nation”, during which he tried to intimidate Senator Gordon with veiled threats of ordering an investigation into the latter’s turf called the Red Cross. It looked to me that the president was nowhere physically and mentally near himself as when he campaigned in 2016. He began, rather tentatively and in disorganized lingo, with a call that the Commission on Audit should look into the transactions of the Red Cross, headed by Gordon. The middle part could have been a legal basis how the COA could open up the books of accounts of a non-government office and which aspect of the Red Cross deals stained the hands of Gordon. None of that sort came. The blank was glaring. The absent data eroded the opening statement. Well, there looked like an assertion that the senator was dishonest which could serve as the conclusion. Number 2 was the appearance of Senator Ronald de la Rosa, who reported a 2019 net worth of P33 million which he probably can leave to his three children. He started his time in the investigation admitting his closeness to the president as if telling the committee that he was there to attempt to distance Duterte from the emerging corruption. It would not be difficult to surmise what prompted the senator to show his discomfort. He realized that the corruption issue could mean the political doom of the president and his allies. The middle of his presentation was made up of leading questions directed towards his poor attempt to cover the DOH deals under investigation. He looked funny. His concluding line had nothing to with the gist of his appearance. Number 3 was a local event. Cebu City Vice Mayor Michael Rama, announced that he will be a candidate for city mayor in 2022. To his blue-blooded supporters, the declaration was most welcome even if it came rather late. Why late? Rama’s friend, Atty. Josephus Jimenez, very early in the present administration, wrote about how the vice mayor had been “marginalized”. It was Atty. Jimenez’ view that Rama’s most ardent campaigners were denied the proverbial victor’s spoils and his endorsements meaningless. I also saw how Rama was backstabbed by supposed political allies. With his announcement, he clarified his stance and put an end to treacherous election-related maneuvering behind him such that his more decent friends can now focus on his candidacy. I like to imagine that this write-up lessens the horrifying implications of the Senate legislative investigation."
1,"Nagkita-kita sa isang simpleng piging ang isang grupo. Hindi sila magkaakumpukan, may social distancing silang sinusunod, pero rock na rock ang kanilang mga chikahan.

Sino na ang makikipaglaban para sa kanila, kanino sila makakasilip ng pag-asa?” madiing punto ni prop.

Napakaayos na ng kanyang posisyon ngayon bilang tagapagtanggol ng mga Pinoy na walang kalaban-labang dumudulog sa kanyang mga programang Wanted Sa Radyo at Idol In Action sa TV5. Malaki na ang kanyang suweldo sa network ay napakalaki pa ng kinikita niya sa mga produktong pumapasok sa kanyang mga programa. Paano pa ang milyones niyang kinikita sa mga social media account niya? Panahon ngayon ni Raffy Tulfo. Nakakatuwa ang mga komentong hindi na nagpupunta sa korte ngayon ang ating mga kababayan, nagsusumbong na lang sila kay Raffy Tulfo, dahil napakabilis niyang umaksiyon. Abangan na lang natin ang kanyang deklarasyon. Siya ang palaging nangunguna sa survey, pangalan niya ang isinisigaw ng ating mga kababayan para maging kinatawan nila sa Senado, hinihintay ng buong bayan ngayon ang kanyang desisyon."
1,"Umiikot ang balita na may hindi pagkakaintindihan ngayon ang dalawang lalaking personalidad na matagal na nagkasama sa isang serye. Sikat na sikat nu’ng kanyang kapanahunan ang mas may edad na male personality, ang ikalawa naman ay mabangung-mabango ang pangalan ngayon, iisa lang ang kanilang linya. Ang makipagbakbakan. Ayon sa kuwento ay napahiya ang mas may edad na aktor sa kanyang mga kinausap dahil biglang tumalikod ang mas nakababatang aktor sa kanilang pinag-usapan. Kuwento ng aming source, “Napakaseryoso pala nu’n ng mas nakababatang male personality na pumasok sa pulitika. Talagang gustung-gusto niya dahil marami rin siyang mga kaibigang pulitiko. “Naniwala siya sa mga sulsol sa kanya na kung tatakbo siya, e, nakabuslo na ang tagumpay niya dahil sikat na sikat nga siya ngayon,” unang kuwento ng aming impormante. Malaking panahon ng mas may edad na aktor ang kinain ng kanilang mga pag-uusap. Inupuan na nila nang maraming beses ang planong tumakbo ng mas batang action star. Patuloy ng aming source, “Marami nang kinausap ang may edad na action star, nagbuo na siya ng team na tutulong sa pagkandidato ng kaibigan niya. Nakahanda na ang lahat pero biglang nagbago ang takbo ng mga pangyayari. “Nu’ng mga sumunod nilang pag-upo, e, marami nang tanong ang younger action star. Bakit daw ang dami-daming kailangang tao na babayaran nila? Anu-ano raw ba ang gagawin ng mga taong kinukuha nila? So, parang nandu’n na ang panghihinayang niya sa pambayad sa team. “Nu’ng ilatag na sa kanya ang kabuuang gagastusin sa kampanya, e, shock boogie ang mas batang action star! Nanglaki ang mga mata niya! Ganu’n daw ba talaga ang kailangang budget sa pagpasok sa pulitika? “Ang ikinalungkot ng mas matandang action star, e, sa telepono lang siya kinausap ng younger action star na ayaw na niyang tumakbo. Wala raw sa dugo niya ang public service. “Alam na this! Nalula lang siya sa laki ng gagastusin niya sa eleksiyon, ayaw lang niyang aminin! Natural, biglang nalungkot ang kausap niya, paano na ang mga kinausap nilang staff bilang paghahanda sa papasukin niyang laban? “Pahiyang-pahiya nga naman ang male personality, sangkatutak ang kinausap niya, pinaghahandaan na ‘yun ng tropa, pero hindi naman pala matutuloy! “Tahimik ang mundo nilang pareho ngayon. Hindi na sila nagkikita at nag-uusap. Palaging nasa probinsiya ngayon ang mas batang action star para sa trabaho niya,” napapailing na pagtatapos ng aming source. Ubos! Tapos na ang boksing! Kahit sabihin pa ngayon ng mga kababayan natin na nang-uulo, nambabayag at yakap nang yakap si Yordenis Ugas sa salpukan nila ng Pambansang Kamao ay pampalubag-loob na lang ang mga ganu’ng reaksiyon. Pero sa kabila ng kabiguan ni Senator Manny Pacquiao ay umani naman siya ng papuri ng buong mundo, pinapurihan si Pacman sa pagtanggap niya sa resulta ng laban, lalo na ng maraming kampeong boksingero na mas nauna kesa sa kanya. Hindi na ‘yun nakapagtataka, kahit sa matatagumpay niyang laban ay walang kayabang-yabang sa katawan si Pacman, sa pagkatalo pa ba naman siya magpapalutang ng kaangasan? Walong titulo ang hawak niya sa magkakaibang dibisyon, mahirap nang mapantayan ang marka niya sa lona, du’n pa lang ay mananatili pa rin si Senador Manny Pacquiao bilang kampeon ng mga kampeon! Ito na nga ang pagbabadya na talikuran na niya ang pakikipagsagupaan, wala na siyang kailangang patunayan pa, ang walong titulong pinagsikapan niyang ipaglaban ay hindi na makakalimutan ng mundo. At napakaganda ng pagtanggap sa kanya maging sa lugar ng laban, pangalan niya ang isinisigaw ng mga Pinoy at banyaga, siya pa rin ang itinuturing na kampeon. At ang pinakamatinding linyang binitiwan niya, ang “This is boxing, we lost tonight, I did my best, I apologize,” ay sinaluduhan ng buong mundo. Buung-buo ang kanyang pagpapakumbaba, tinanggap niya ang katotohanan na tinalo siya ni Ugas (na Ungas kung tawagin ngayon ng ating mga kababayan), ang katangian niyang ‘yun ang dahilan kaya siya mahal na mahal ng buong bayan. Una ay nagkakaedad na si Pacman. Bumagal na rin ang kanyang galaw. Kailangan na talaga niyang magpahinga sa boksing. Milagro na ang ibinigay sa kanya ng propesyong pinili niya. Mula sa isang payak na buhay ay bilyonaryo na siya ngayon. Panahon na para isuko niya ang pakikipagbasagan ng mukha at pakikipagbugbugan ng katawan. Panahon na para bigyan niya naman ng kasiyahan ang kanyang sarili sa piling ng kanyang pamilya. Walang forever sa kahit anong larangan. Pansamantala lang ang lahat ng bagay. Regaluhan na dapat ni Pacman ang kanyang sarili ng produkto ng kanyang pagpupunyagi. Anuman ang nangyari, si Pacquiao pa rin ang kampeon ng mga kampeon sa puso ng mga Pinoy, siya pa rin!"
1,"Kapin na lang sa usa ka buwan ug tunga, mo-Oktubre na, ug kon walay mga kakulian, ang mga kandidato mo-file na sa ilang mga Certificates of Candidacies (COC).  Apan sa pagkakaron, gumikan kaha niining atong giatubang karon nga pandemic, both sa mga kampo sa administrasyon ug sa oposisyon, wala pay opisyal nga gituboy kinsa ang ilang padaganon pagka-presidente. Kutob pa lang sila sa sabut-sabot ug pagsuta kinsa ang winnable nga mga prospects, ug kinsa ang makadani ug makapadayag ngadto sa katawhan nga sila ang tubag sa mga problema nga ato karong gisagubang (gawas sa pandeimic). Matud ni Jarius Bondoc sa Philippine Star: “Administration, opposition both split 3 ways for president.” Gihinganlan ni Jarius ang tagtulo ka posibling magkandidato; Sila si Sara Duterte, Bong Go, ug Manny Pacquiao, sa habig sa administrasyon (dili diay mag-oposisyon si Pacquiao?), ug sila si Leni Robredo, Isko Moreno, ug Ping Lacson, sa oposisyon. Mao ba? Daghan ang mga factors o mga kahigayonan o hinungdan nga mapilian pagka-official candidate ang mga nagdamgo nga mag-presidente, sama sa, una sa tanan, logistics, kwarta;  local kingpins’ support; campaign machinery; kinsa ang mahimong runningmate nga makatampo sa kadaugan sa pagka-presidente;  mga pilionon pagka-senador ug pagka-representante, lakip na sa mga local candidates; platform, consistent survey ranking, ug political convenience. Dili kini sayon. Una sa tanan, kinahanglan daghan kaayo ka’g campaign funds, kay sa kaugalingon nimong kampanya, gastoan man usab nimo ang ubang mga kandidato aron dad-on ka sa ilang lineup. Pagkakaron, ang poll frontrunner mao si  Inday Sara, bisan tuod og wala pa siya mo-deklarar officially sa tinguha pagdagan. Apan, matud ni Jarius: “But ‘Run, Inday, Run’ tarps have been posted in cities and sitios as early as February. The multimillion-peso cost and coverage entice politicos to join her bandwagon. Her Davao regional coalition has inked local alliances in Luzon and the Visayas.” Sa pangagpas ni Jarius, nakabintaha si Inday Sara. Maoy hinungdan nga daghan ang nagpaluyo kaniya, nisakay sa bandwagon, mga political parties ug individual nga mga lungsoranon. Basta dumadaog gani ka, daghan ang magpaluyo ug muagak kanimo. Ug ang itandem ni Sara, sila si Martin Romualdez, mo-representar sa Kabisay-an, ug either si Bongbong Marcos o si Gibo Teodoro sa Luzon. So, matud ni Jarius, kon kinsa ang mahimong ka-tandem ni Sara, “Any one of them will bolster the geographic tandem for the mayor of Davao City in Mindanao. Hinuon, medyo adunay komplikasyon tungod kay si Bongbong gihugonhugon nga interesado usab nga modagan pagka-presidente. Gisaligan ni Bongbong mao ang ilang Solid North nga tinuod gayud nga solid. Wala kitay Solid Visayas ug walay Solid Mindanao. Ato da kining maklaro sa dii pa ang Oktubre. Kahibawo man ta nga sa politika sa atong nasud, anything goes. Ang imong kaaway karon, mahimo nga imong ikadulog ugma; ug ang imong gikadulog karon, mahimo nga imong i-kaaway ugma. Sa kampo sa oposisyon, it seems nga dili sila magkasabot, daghan ang gustong mag-presidente.  Matud ni Jarius:  “Opposition factions know that unity is their only chance against the Duterte combine. Yet they ignore 1Sambayan’s plea for a common slate.” Seguro ang ilang kapildihan kon dili sila magkahiusa."
1,"The other day was August 13. It was the only Friday the 13th of this year quite, unlike 2015 which had three, particularly in the months of February, March and November. By the way, my daughter Beatriz celebrates her birthday on November 13, and she was born on a Friday. While many people don’t attach any meaning to Friday the 13th, it’s considered an unlucky day in western civilization. From the internet, I learned that an estimated 17 to 21 million people in the United States are affected by a fear of this day, making it the most feared day and date in history. Some people are so paralyzed by fear that they avoid their normal routines in doing business, taking flights, or even getting out of bed. I might not really be that superstitious still I couldn’t help but attach some meaning to an otherwise petty incident. While watching during that Friday the 13th afternoon my favorite TV newscasters Bobby Nalzaro, Alan Domingo, and Cecille Quibod Castro doing their routine Balitang Bisdak, our doorbell rang in great succession as if there was an emergency. I reacted agitatedly. I had to break away from Bobby’s report on Lapu-Lapu City being placed under MECQ because rushing to our gate. But, there was nobody. The bell ringer could be a ghost or he ran away as fast as Lamont Marcell Jacobs of Italy, the Tokyo 2020 Olympics champion in the 100-meter dash, who ran the distance in 9.80 seconds. Whoever rang our doorbell, he left an envelope. I knew that it was not an explosive device of the kind used by Timothy McVeigh, to destroy the Alfred Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City, but after I examined its contents I realized that it was a political bomb. Who brought the documents to me was my first question. I surmised the bell ringer was with BOPK because the photocopied papers evinced a corrupt practice of a City Hall official. Perhaps, the source of the documents thought I would be so incensed by this official’s callousness that I would initiate an anti-graft case against him. He had a point. The sender of the possibly damning evidence could also be a City Hall insider and probably someone closely allied to Mayor Edgardo Labella, politically speaking as PDP, Partido Barug, Kusug, or Panaghiusa. He could have seen the mayor’s name was on the papers yet his signatures were missing and thought I would file an appropriate case against the official but not against the mayor. It was not the first time I received documents that, after serious evaluation, would show graft and corruption in the city government. Actually, the same official figured in both instances and the documents carried millions of pesos of people’s money apparently stolen. There is a technical drawback though. All papers are photocopies and cannot be used in court, but while there are ways to overcome this obstacle, I have yet no reason to assume the role as a BOPK warrior. On the other hand, prosecuting the high official (excluding the mayor) could be a way to help him cleanse his name. But in spite of the nobility of the intention, I could get easily misunderstood enough as to be accused of treachery against the city chief executive. Being a traitor is anathema to a Tau Kappa Lambda fraternity brother. At this point, let me speculate. Maybe the document sender felt his insignificance compared to the high official as to be easily bamboozled by the latter’s counter-attack or that he feared the Ombudsman as beneficiary of the high official’s illegal pot as to dismiss his charges. Any sense?"
1,"Gerrymandering is a pernicious political move to rearrange congressional constituencies in order to favor some scheming politicians or to push political enemies to oblivion or irrelevance. This originated from an American politician who became a US vice president, former Massachusetts governor Elbridge Gerry. He signed a bill that created a new district in Boston with the configuration of a salamander. His name is forever slandered by naming this deplorable political move to dishonor him. In the next year's national and local elections, Mandaue City will be considered an independent city with its own representative, thus leaving Consolacion and Cordova as the only remaining constituencies of the sixth district. This is touted by politicians as good for Mandaue City, but as a whole, it may not be good to the taxpayers, who are bound to support and finance, through additional taxes, another member of the oversized House of Representatives, who shall hire his multiple staff and consultants, thereby exacerbating government expenditures at a time of great economic depression. By virtue of Republic Act 11257, the numbers of congressmen from Cebu will reach the unprecedented number of 11 plus other party-list representatives based in our province. That would include the seven from the province of Cebu plus two from Cebu City, and one from Lapu-Lapu, and now another one from Mandaue. Too much taxes to finance officials who are still to show what they have accomplished all the time that they were in Congress. I have no problem with Congressman Eduardo R Gullas, who has worked hard for the first district, resulting in the unparalleled economic development of Minsan si Carnata, which is the acronym for Minglanilla, San Fernando, Sibonga, Carcar, Naga, and Talisay. We also see the progress of the third district under Deputy Speaker PJ Garcia. But the people are waiting for the performance report of the rest of the representatives. Mandaue City has qualified under the criteria set forth by law but the authors of this law should have considered the effect on the remaining two municipalities. Cordova is the smallest town in the whole province of Cebu. It is a third-class municipality surrounded by the mega city of Cebu, the booming city of Lapu-Lapu and the burgeoning city of Mandaue. Cordova looks like a diminutive sparrow in a family of eagles. It has only 17.15 square kilometers in area, smaller than a barangay of Balamban. Cordova has only 13,167 households and a revenue of P130,062,371.57. It has 13 barangays comprising very small areas. You can go around the whole municipality in less than 30 minutes riding a motorcycle. The other part of the constituency is Consolacion, which is quite removed and not contiguous to Cordova. The distance between the two towns is more than 17 kilometers or 9 miles away from each other. According to Wikipedia, it takes one hour and 17 minutes to travel from one to the other. I think that is quite exaggerated, but if we consider the traffic, that is not far-fetched. Consolacion has an area of only 37.03 square kilometers, smaller than Samboan, Liloan, Compostela and Ronda. Combining Cordova's 17.15 and the area of Consolacion, 37.03, taxpayers will be paying a congressman who shall represent a very small area of only 54.18 square kilometers. That is only less than one-fourth of Barangay BF Homes, where I reside in Paranaque. I know that if my good friend, the great Adelino Sitoy, were alive today, he would be running unopposed to represent this new district. Now that Manoy Adie has passed on, representation of the smallest area in Congress will be a toss-up between the Sitoys of Cordova and the Alegados of Consolacion. In terms of numbers, the Alegados have the upperhand. But in terms of moral ascendancy, they might give it to a scion of the Sitoys. Whatever it will be, I still believe that Consolacion should be added to the fifth district, and Cordova should be appended to Lapu-Lapu. We need to put a stop to this scheme of gerrymandering in small constituencies. Whenever trapos want to spread their wings, the hoi polloi picks up the bill. That is another point against democracy."
1,"Political strategists for 2022 should now look at the demographics. The combined voting population of Regions 6, 7, and 8 is about 13.5 million and that constitutes more than 20% of the whole country. It is much smaller than Luzon, which commands 55.95% for seven regions, including Metro Manila. Visayas, with only three regions, has a smaller voting population compared to Mindanao with regions 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 (Caraga) and the Bangsa Moro Region. Nonetheless, most of the provinces are vote-rich, especially, Cebu, Iloilo, Negros Occidental, Bohol, and Leyte. To win the presidency, the candidates must court all governors. They must be ready to help finance the governor's candidacy and it means billions and billions in funds. Of course, Region 6 has a lot of billionaires who may not need much help from national candidates. Let's start from the west. The governor of Capiz is Esteban Contreras, an independent. Aklan has a governor who belongs to the PDP, Florencio Miraflores. In Antique, NUP's Rhodora Candao won over PDP's Paolo Javier. But PDP's Guimaras Governor Samuel Gumarin won 93% of the votes. Iloilo's Art Defensor Jr. belongs to the PDP. Eugenio Lacson, governor of Negros Occidental is with the NPC. He also won 94% of the votes. Negros Oriental is under an NP governor, Roel Degamo. But Siquijor's Zaldy Villa is with PDP. Bohol's Art Yap is also with PDP as well as Cebu's Gwen Garcia. Leyte's governor, Leopold Petilla, is a member of the PDP. Southern Leyte's Damian Mercado is PDP. Biliran's Roger Espina is with NP. Eastern Samar's Ben Evardone is PDP. Northern Samar's Edwin Onchuan belongs to the NUP. And Samar's Milagrosa Tan is PDP. The voting population of Region 8, composed of three provinces of Leyte and three provinces of Samar has 3.2 million voters, constituting about 5% of the total national voters. Region 7, with vote-rich Cebu and Bohol, plus the smaller Negros Oriental and the tiny island province of Siquijor, has 5.1 million voters, comprising 8% of the national total voting population. Region 6, composed of Aklan, Antique, Capiz, Guimaras, Iloilo, and Negros Occidental has 5 million, which is 7.8% of the whole nation's voters. Samar and Leyte are historically loyal to the Romualdez political leaders, and thus always supporting the Marcoses. But we can no longer be sure of that now. There are many young voters with different sets of values and loyalties. What remains immutable is that election campaigns need so much funding and organization. And the local leaders, including the governors can shift their allegiance easily at the drop of a hat. If the hat contains millions, of course. If you are a local candidate for governor, and you are a strong one, with much popularity, like Governor Gwen of Cebu, presidential candidates will most probably line up to court you and offer you funding assistance, in exchange for support for the presidency and vice presidency. Of course, I expect them to deny this and claim that they are not for sale. That is the politically correct thing to say. The compelling truth though is that the national elections in 2022 will demand too much budget from presidential candidates and other aspirants for national posts. These people must help finance those running for governor and other local positions. If they will not, then they might as well as say goodbye to their dream of winning the Palace. And local support is a precious commodity. To run for president, you need at the very least P10 billion. If you do not have that, you should be prepared to lose to a lesser-qualified but more moneyed aspirant. That is how the cookie crumbles. It is a shame and we need to change this. But, as of now, it is politically stupid not to face the truth."
1,"The head of Lebanon's Hezbollah on Saturday warned against ""politicizing"" a probe into a deadly port blast last year, rejecting accusations that the group was involved in bringing explosive fertilizer to the dockside. Hassan Nasrallah spoke after Lebanon on Wednesday marked one year since hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrate fertilizer exploded at a Beirut port warehouse, killing at least 214 people and wrecking swathes of the city. The Shiite group's detractors have in recent weeks claimed it was involved in bringing the substance to the port so it could travel on to neighboring Syria for its ally the Damascus government to use in barrel bombs during the Syrian civil war. But Nasrallah in a televised speech dismissed these accusations as ""fabricated"" and ""ridiculous"". ""As if Hezbollah which has weapons and rockets... needs to bring in nitrate,"" added the head of the Iran-backed group. ""As if, with its warehouses to fit tens of thousands of rockets, it did not have warehouses in which to put the nitrate."" He dismissed the accusations as ""political targeting paid for by America and Saudi Arabia in service of Israel"". It emerged after the explosion that officials had known the ammonium nitrate had been lingering at the port for years. A local probe was launched into the disaster but has stalled, with families of the victims and survivors growing increasingly angry and accusing politicians of trying to hamper it at every turn. Nasrallah in his speech also took a swipe at the lead judge probing the explosion, calling on him to provide proof to back up his decision to summon current and former officials for questioning in the case. ""Where is the evidence?"" he said, calling on Judge Tareq Bitar to share the results. The judge is demanding that parliament lift the immunity of three former ministers so he can proceed with investigations, but lawmakers have requested more evidence before deciding on whether to waive immunity. Bitar has rejected parliament's request. The caretaker interior minister also did not allow Bitar to question top intelligence official Abbas Ibrahim over the blast. ""The investigation is politicised,"" Nasrallah said. ""Either he must work... in a clear manner or the judiciary must find another judge."" In February, Bitar's predecessor was removed by a court, which had questioned his impartiality because his home had been damaged in the explosion. — Agence France-Presse"
1,"A consummate politician told me, many years ago, that politics is the art of compromise. In fact, he pursued his statement by saying that a politician, to be truly successful, need not play his game “too good”. There are times that he should compromise even his basic tenets in order to survive. I am not at liberty to reveal his name because the truth is that it was his counsel for me not to play it too good that caused the breakup of our alliance. It offended my youthful idealism. More than being an art of compromise, politics makes strange bedfellows. I mean those times when men, different in political persuasions, come together and join forces to pursue a desired common goal. The internet explained the meaning of this mid-19th century idiom thus “meaning political alliances in a common cause that may bring together those of widely differing views.” There are recent observable signs that point to politicians of different colors here in Cebu City becoming strange bedfellows. A focal point of observation is Kasambagan Barangay Capt. Franklyn Ong. Following Ong’s victory in the 2018 barangay elections, he set his attention at becoming the head of the Association of Barangay Councils (ABC). He locked horns with Mabolo Barangay Capt. Niña Mabatid. Both of them were allied with the group of former mayor Tomas Osmeña. We then observed that their battle royale was a war of logistics that Ong won. Today, if you happen to go around the city, you will see hundreds of large tarpaulins posted in almost every conceivable location. These are very expensive-looking materials that carry the face of Ong printed alongside the picture of other barangay captains. In Barangay Pit-os for instance, the photo of Barangay Capt. Nilo Tariman is printed on the tarpaulins with that of Ong’s while in Barangay Mabini, it is the image of Barangay Capt. Richard Adolfo’s. True, these tarpaulins announce a vigorous campaign for people to get vaccinated, but we see a political gimmickry behind it. And we have to acknowledge the advertising acumen of the Kasambagan village chief. Early on in my mind, I thought that Barangay Capt. Franklin Ong was aiming to be vice mayor of this city. There were persistent reports that he would be the running mate of former mayor Tomas Osmeña. Their team-up would form a formidable opponent of an Edgardo Labella-Michael Rama tandem. But, lately, there have been reports that the face-off of Osmeña and Labella is not happening because the former is focused on getting the congressional representation of the south district and the latter is hounded by health concerns. It is thus bruited that Rep. Bebot Abellanosa will run for mayor and the BOPK will push Ong to be the vice mayoralty candidate. Amidst all these are reports that Ong is not the best of Abellanosa’s friends. In fact, in some ABC meetings, Ong pounds questions on Abellanosa’s projects. Some of Ong’s allies who are not Osmeña supporters are asking that Rama take him as a running mate. If that should happen, we shall see the concretization of this thing called “strange bedfellows”."
1,"On the heels of jaw-dropping heat and flooding across three continents, nearly 200 nations gather Monday to validate a critical UN climate science report 100 days ahead of a political summit charged with keeping Earth liveable. The world is a different place than in 2014, when the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued its fifth comprehensive assessment of global heating, past and future. Lingering doubts that warming was gathering pace or almost entirely human in origin, along with the falsely reassuring notion that climate impacts are tomorrow's problem, have since evaporated in the haze of record heat, wildfires and crippling droughts. Indeed, an unprecedented cascade of lethal weather this summer --Death Valley-like temperatures in western Canada, flash floods across western Europe, people drowning in rain-filled subway carriages in central China-– could make 2021 the year that climate predictions become a reality impossible to ignore. Another milestone since the last IPCC tome; the Paris Agreement has been adopted, setting a collective target of capping the planet's surface temperature at ""well below"" two degrees Celsius (35.6 Fahrenheit) above late-19th century levels. Carbon pollution from burning fossil fuels, methane leaks and agriculture has driven up the thermometer 1.1C so far. The 2015 treaty also tacked on an aspirational limit of 1.5C, with many parties to the talks assuming it would remain just that --aspirational, and thus easy to set aside. ""But then countries turned around and asked the IPCC to do a special report on it, and that changed the framing absolutely,"" IPCC lead author and palaeoclimatologist Peter Thorne of Maynooth University in Ireland, told AFP. The resulting 2018 analysis revealed just how devastating an extra half-degree of warming would be, and today 1.5C is the only number on the table. Low-balling the threat ""It became the de facto target"", and proof of the IPCC's influence in shaping global policy, Thorne said in a Zoom interview. A third sea change over the last seven years is in the science itself. ""Today we have better climate projection models, and longer observations with a much clearer signal of climate change,"" climatologist Robert Vautard, also an IPCC lead author and director of France's Pierre-Simon Laplace Institute, told AFP. Arguably the biggest breakthrough is so-called attribution studies, which for the first time allow scientists to rapidly quantify the extent to which climate change has boosted an extreme weather event's intensity or likelihood. Within days, for example, of the deadly ""heat dome"" that scorched Canada and the western US last month, the World Weather Attribution consortium calculated that the heatwave would have been virtually impossible without manmade warming. But after-the-fact analysis is not the same as foresight, and the IPCC -- set up in 1988 to inform UN climate negotiations -- has been criticised by some for low-balling the danger, a pattern that Harvard science historian Naomi Oreskes has called ""erring on the side of least drama"". ""First, there is the general conservatism of science -- in many ways that's a good thing,"" she told AFP. ""But in the climate change arena, scientists have had to deal with an enormous political and cultural pressure not to 'exaggerate' the threat."" The IPCC, she added, must contend with direct interference from the governments on whose behalf it works. ""I think there's little doubt that the effect of outside pressure, overall, has been to cause its statements to fall on the 'less alarmed' rather than 'more alarmed' side of things."" From Monday, representatives from 195 nations, with scientists at their elbow, will vet a 20- to 30-page ""summary for policymakers"" line-by-line, word-by-word. Low-probability, high-risk The virtual meeting for this first installment --covering physical science-- of the three-part report will take two weeks rather than the usual one, with the document's release slated for August 9. Part two of the report, to be published in February 2022, covers impacts. A leaked draft obtained by AFP warns that climate change will fundamentally reshape life on Earth in the coming decades even if planet-warming carbon pollution is tamed, and calls for ""transformational change"" lest future generations face far worse.

1,"CEBU, Philippines — Mga politiko gikinahanglan may pagtugot gikan sa Emergency Operations Center kun sila maghimo og mga pulong-pulong ug mga political rallies karong nagkaduol naman ang umaabot nga piniliay sa tuig 2022. Si Police Lieutenant Colonel Wilbert Parilla, deputy director for operations sa Cebu City Police mitug-an sa mga tigbalita nga mao kini ang nasabotan atol sa panagtigum tali nilang Cebu City Director Police Colonel Josefino Ligan ug EOC deputy chief implementer Konsehal Joel Garganera  bahin sa mga political rallies. Nabantayan sa nanglabay nga mga buwan nagsige na og ari ug pagpakita ang mga politiko dinhi sa Sugbu lakip na kadtong nangambisyon og posisyon sa nasudnong kagamhanan.

1,"In the realm of Visayan politics, which are controlled by family dynasties, there is a new golden rule: He who owns the gold rules. It simply means that the family who controls the economy would necessarily control the politics. If a family owns the biggest haciendas in the locality, it is only logical that they should protect their possessions by making sure that the governor and the mayor are theirs. Otherwise, their operations can be hampered by ordinances that make business difficult. Look at the Visayan provinces. The clans that control the economic enterprises are also the political kingpins. Any brilliant outsider who rises is surely under their control and domination. Consider the province of Leyte. It has always been under the Loreto, Petilla, Cari, and Veloso clans. Tacloban and the first district have never gone outside the Romualdez family, except only when one guy named Ted Failon, thanks to ABS-CBN, defeated Romualdez as representative of the first district but only for one term and never again. The most famous, of course, is Imelda, the jewel of the Waray region, and his favorite brother Benjamin Kokoy who was both governor of Leyte and ambassador to the USA. Imelda's other brother, Alfredo “Bejo,” is the father of congressman Martin, majority leader and husband of another member of Congress, Yedda Marie Mendoza, party-list representative. Other members of the clan were Speaker Daniel Romualdez (the airport was named in his honor), and the children of Imelda, Senator Bongbong, the ex-future president, Senator Imee and her children who are now governors and congressmen in Ilocos Norte. Northern Samar is dominated by the family of Raul Daza and Emil Ong. Samar, the western part of the island, is dominated by the Tan family who controlled Catbalogan, except one district in the north which was won by Edgar Sarmiento, covering Calbayog City. Eastern Samar, facing the Pacific, was won by Ben Evardone as governor and congresswoman Fe Abunda, sister of TV host Boy Abunda. Southern Leyte has been ruled by the Mercados after the era of Nicanor Yniguez. Damian Mercado is governor and congressman Roger remains in control. Biliran is still dominated by the Espinas. And Bohol, with Art Yap as governor, is still controlled by the clans of the Chattos, Relampagos, and Aumentados. This is the province of Carlos P Garcia, Francisco Dagohoy and Rajah Sikatuna, and the home of Yoyoy Villame. The rich and landed families hold the political powers since time immemorial. Negros Oriental, used to be dominated by the Teves clan, is now an exception to the rule. Governor Roel Degamo is still governor and Doc Macias is vice governor. The representatives are Josy Limcaichong, Chiquiting Sagarbarria and Arnie Teves. But in 2019, many dynasties crumbled. The landed Luzuriagas in Tayasan were defeated. The Baldados in Ayungon lost, too. The Ibar Teves dynasty in Tanjay has been demolished. The Dionaldos of Jimalalud and the Bautistas of Canlaon were vanquished. But the Teveses of Bayawan and Valencias remained impregnable. The Reyes dynasty in Guihulngan is undefeated. Negros Occidental is controlled by the rich hacienderos, the Montillas, Maranons, Lacsons, Montelibanos, Gatuslaos, Ferrers, Arroyos, Alvarez. The governor is Bong Lacson, and the vice governor is Jeffrey Ferrer. The representatives are Ginggo Valmayor, Bebo Cuevas, Kiko Benitez, Juliet Marie Ferrer, Marilou Arroyo and Lim-ao Alvarez. Siquijor's governor is Jecoy Villa and its lone representative is Jecjec Villa. In Iloilo, the first district is controlled by the Garins. Dr Janette is representing the first district. The other representatives are Michael Gorriceta of the second, Lorenz R Defensor (my student in UST, classmate of Speaker Alan Lord Velasco) of the third, Braeden John Biron of the fourth, Raul Tupas of the fifth, and Julienne Baronda of Iloilo City. The governor of Aklan is Florencio Miraflores and the congressmen are Carlito Marquez of the first district and Teodorico Haresco Jr of the second district. Antique's governor is Rhodora Cadiao, and the lone representative is former senator Loren Legarda. The Capiz governor is Esteban Contreras. The two representatives are Emmanuel Billones and Fredenil Castro. Guimaras governor is Samuel Gumarin and its representative is Ma Lucille Nava. If we examine the interconnections between the economic dominance and election results, we shall find one thing conclusive: The economic elites are also the political kingpins. Politics in the Visayas, like that in most of the country, are largely feudal, transactional and paternalistic. We have not grown in terms of political maturity and the way we elect officials is not based on principles, ideology or platforms, but on personalities, economic domination and convenience."
1,"“The Tipping Point” is a best-selling book published by Malcolm Gladwell in 2000 that sold more than four million copies worldwide. And I cannot find my copy. It is a socio-economic analysis that when an idea, trend, or social behavior tips spread like wildfire, it takes very little to tip the situation. Gladwell actually considers both the upward and downward tipping point, but “inflection point” is more descriptive of an upward swing. The tipping point is more akin to “the last straw that broke the camel’s back”, in the Bible. The book points out the importance of context, external circumstances and the environment in reaching the tipping point, so political tipping points are the most important since they affect the lives of many people and are probably the most historically dramatic events. The rise and fall of political ideologies like communism, democracy, and socialism in many countries have had their tipping points over the years, and many lessons have been learned. Examples would be the fall of the Roman Empire, the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution, the Chinese Revolution, the loss of the British colonies, the Philippine revolution against Spain, and the EDSA revolution against the Marcos dictatorship. These are all about reaching the boiling point, achieving critical mass, and reaching the threshold. The events in Myanmar, Cuba, Venezuela, and Hong Kong are percolating and are potentially on the way to boiling points, especially with the extensive social media penetration in all social classes. So, you can see that all the governments in these countries are trying their best to control the internet in these places. Authoritarian countries are particularly sensitive of criticism, so they control external circumstances or environment to avoid tipping point critical mass. The Philippine political situation is in a similar path but may be of a lesser volatility, but certainly in an interesting condition as the government response to the COVID-19 pandemic, to public health, and the economy are wanting, on top of the sovereignty issue with China, corruption, and human rights violations. That the government is mounting a massive propaganda campaign with trolls and positioning pro-government candidates for continuity, is indicative of the instability of their position and awareness of their possible tipping points. Most politicians are actually aware of their tipping points, and the building of family political dynasties is a way of postponing the tipping points. But many people in power are blinded/surrounded by supporters who are actually protecting their own interests that they do not see or refuse to see the incoming tipping points. If a capital investment analysis is done on the Internal Rate of Return, of investing political, human and financial capital to win an election, very few would yield a positive return. The depletion/depreciation on the health, family life, the family reputation and finances of the candidates will surely outweigh the perceived benefits. At best it is a power trip which may be psychologically needed by the politician. All the current maneuverings for the coming elections in 10 months are designed to postpone the inevitable that everything ends. Tipping points are always reached and it is just a matter of when and how disastrous it will be for the politicians and the people governed. It could be a peaceful transition, or a deadly revolution as had happened over the years in many countries. This is the natural law of the universe, or God’s Law."
1,"The problem with an eight-time world boxing champion entering the treacherous terrain of Philippine politics is really the risk of assuming that winning a political showdown is easier than knocking out a reigning welterweight title holder. Manny Pacquiao might have been the historic holder of eight boxing championship belts. But in politics, he is just a novice. If he thinks that conquering tried and tested veterans like Digong Duterte in 2022, is easier than knocking out Errol Spence Jr. on August 21, he might yet taste the bitterest surprise of his life. His aspiration might be noble, but his moves are naive. Pacquiao won the WBC flyweight championship in 1998 when he knocked out Chatchai Sasakul. In 2001, Pacquiao won the IBF super bantamweight championship. He was able to defend that championship four times in a row. He also won The Ring featherweight championship defeating Marco Antonio Barrera by TKO in 2003. He defended that title twice. In 2008, he won over Juan Manuel Marquez, thereby getting two titles: WBC's super featherweight and The Ring super featherweight, although it was via split decision. Also in 2008, Pacquiao won the WBC lightweight title over David Diaz. Pacquiao was very successful in boxing. The danger now is for his team to think that the field of politics is as easy as boxing. In 2009, Pacquiao also won The Ring light welterweight championship by knocking out Ricky Hatton, to the great dismay of the boxing enthusiasts. This was followed also in 2009 when Pacquiao won the WBO welterweight title by beating Miguel Cotto. He defended that title three times. In 2010, Pacquiao also won the WBC lightweight championship by unanimous decision over Antonio Margarito. In 2014, Pacquiao won by unanimous decision over Timothy Bradley, thereby winning the WBO welterweight world championship. In 2016, he won by unanimous decision over Jessie Vargas, thereby regaining the WBO welterweight world title. In 2019, he won by split decision over Keith Thurman, winning the WBA super welterweight title. Pacquiao is the only world boxing champion with 12 major titles in eight different divisions. Not even Muhammad Ali and other boxing giants ever achieved that feat. Pacquiao, now 42, has had 71 boxing fights. He won 62 of them, 39 by knockout, and lost seven, with two draws. On August 21, he will fight Errol Spence, 31. This younger guy had figured in 27 fights and won all of them, with 21 knockouts. Thus, Pacquiao is facing a formidable fighter, a younger, taller and bigger one. But despite all these disadvantages, Pacquiao is the favorite. But I’m quite concerned because his mind isn’t focused on the fight. He keeps on being affected by the verbal attacks from Malacañang and the Cusi wing of PDP-Laban. Pacquiao is distracted and his mind isn’t concentrated on the August 21 showdown. This predicament may cause his downfall both in boxing and is politics. That would be a case of grasp all, lose all. And that would be very sad for all of us. The mistake of Pacquiao, or the lousy advice of his political advisers, was for him to pick a fight with the president at a crucial time of his pre-boxing preparations. He should not be fighting two battlefronts at the same time. He should have waited until September when he should have already knocked out Spence and picked up some millions of dollars in Las Vegas. He could have postponed his attacks against the administration after the fight. To me, that was a crucial faux pas which could cost him both the boxing championship and the presidency in 2022. I really wonder if Pacquiao has a competent political handler. And if he has, then I dare say that he should fire him and look for a better one. Pacquiao may be the best boxer in all history in the whole world. But in politics, he is just like Onyok Velasco challenging Muhammad Ali. He should wake up to the harsh reality of dog eat dog, survival of the fittest, and elimination of the unfit. If he doesn’t get a very shrewd, savvy, and sagacious handler, then he will be eaten alive by the ferocious predators and scheming strategists and tacticians in the opposite camp. Pacquiao should not only be pure as a dove. He should also be wise as a serpent and deadly as a scorpion because he is entering the caves of wolves, cobras, and hyenas."
1,"NAPAPANSIN n’yo ba na wala pang pulitiko na nagdedeklara na sila’y tatakbo bilang Presidente, Bise Presidente o senador. May nagpaparinig, nagpapahaging, nagpapabebe o nagpapakiyeme. Mga pahiwatig na interesado, posible, depende, puwede pero walang deklarasyon na “oo, tatakbo ako.” Ang maririnig na maingay ay ang kanilang mga chuwari-wariwap na kaalyado o spokesperson at hindi mismo sa bibig ng pulitikong tatakbo. Bakit nga ba? Tila naghihintayan sila, nagbabantayan at nagpapakiramdaman. Tatlong buwan na lamang ay filing na ng kandidatura, medyo atrasado na sa preparasyon ang ating mga pulitiko. Eto ang mga posibleng dahilan: Maaaring sila’y nag-aalangan na kapag nagdeklara ng kandidatura nang maaga ay kukuyugin. Hindi pa sila nag-uumpisa ay gigibain na. Walang partido na susuporta. Kung hindi ka personalidad o hindi ka masyadong kilala, sorry ka. Walang plataporma. Kung meron man kasing nakahanda na, dapat nailatag na nila. Platapormang pakikinggan ng taumbayan, paniniwalaan ng publiko’t makakamtan ng mga Pilipino. Walang pondo at makinarya. Importante ito lalo na’t national position ang iyong target. Malaking katanungan kung saan kukuha ng pondo at sino ang iyong supporters. At isyung continuity o change. Itutuloy o babaguhin nga ba ang sistema ng kasalukuyang administrasyon. Sino sa kanila ang magsasabing “conitune” at sino ang magsasabing “change”."
1,"The country’s political cauldron is brewing. What are we to do? The period for filing of certificates of candidacy for all elective positions is still 80 days from today, that’s from October 1 to 8. Yet it’s never too early at this stage for potential candidates to make their important moves. Because Cebu is a vote-rich island, we are sure to have a front-seat view of the political movements at the national level. Presidential daughter, Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte, and her party, Hugpong ng Pagbabago, were in Cebu recently to “scan the environment” and talk to the people here, according to state-run Philippine News Agency. Other potential candidates will surely follow, like Senator Manny Pacquiao and the tandem of senators Panfilo Lacson and Vicente Sotto III. I am somewhat privy to some movements in Cebu by supporters of at least two political camps. They have definitely started organizing both at the grassroots level and at the level of party coalition-building. One reason I know is that one camp’s organizer has asked if I could front the campaign’s legal division in Cebu. Though we lawyers are taught not to choose clients based on our political beliefs, when it comes to electing our leaders, I believe I have the right to carefully choose whom I associate myself with. Thus, I politely declined the proposal, citing with candor that my vote is already reserved for Vice President Leni Robredo. To be clear, anyone associated with Robredo’s camp is not a client and will not be a client. But I already vowed to myself that I won’t be involved in the campaign of any other presidential contender whom I won’t be voting for. There is that little chance that I might change my mind over the course of the campaign, of course. It will depend on how the candidates perform in the campaign and their stance on most issues that I care about. But let me go back to my question earlier. What are we to do amid these political developments? I say that you should register at the nearest Comelec office of your place of residence if you have not registered yet. This advice goes especially to young people, aged 18 to 30, who are estimated to comprise over 30% of the vote. The next thing you can do is research. It is too early to surrender and join the bandwagon based on who leads in the surveys. Don’t be easily swayed by surveys and those hard-sell, giant posters of politicians you see on the road. History tells us that those who shine so brightly at this stage may yet quickly burn out at the penultimate stage. Once you’ve done your research, volunteer if you can. Your chosen candidates don’t owe you anything during the campaign. It is you who owe them your support, in whatever form you can give. So that if they win, they owe you their utmost, honest, and most competent service. We stand at a critical crossroads in this 2022 elections. One road is dotted with large potholes of kakistocracy, abuse of power, and corruption. Another one promises something different but is actually more of the same. Yet another one is probably what I could settle for. It is the one that promises to bring back the momentum of the PNoy presidency – a robust economy, investor confidence, decency in governance, and a top-level commitment in the fight against corruption – hopefully, with a twist; that is, with a heart and genuine connection for the people in the grassroots."
1,"Eto ha, may babala na si PNP Chief Gen. Guillermo Eleazar­ sa kanyang mga tauhan na iwasang makisangkot sa partisan politics. Posibleng pagkasibak sa serbisyo ang kakaharapin ng mga pulis kung mapapatunayang sangkot sa  partisan politics. Nanindigan ang PNP na wala umanong puwang ang pulitika sa mga pulis sa partisan politics, kundi ang dapat mangi­babaw ay pagseserbisyo sa taumbayan at hindi sa iilang pulitiko. Kung gusto nga namang makisangkot ng mga pulis sa puli­tika, mas makabubuti umano na mag-resign sila sa serbisyo kung nais nilang tumakbo o sumuporta sa kanilang kandidato. Nag-ugat ang ganitong pahayag ng PNP chief matapos namang sibakin ng Napolcom  ang anim na pulis sa Negros Oriental na napatunayang sangkot sa illegal search at seizure  sa bahay ng isang bise alklade doon noong 2017. Lumalabas na harassment ang nangyari, matapos na magpahayag ang bise alkalde sa pagtakbong mayor kalaban ng incumbent mayor noon. Eto pa, bukod sa pagkasibak sa serbisyo, posibleng matanggalan ng benepisyo at retirement ang pulis na masasangkot sa  partisan politics. Madalas kasi na kapag nalalapit na ang halalan may ilang mga pulitiko ang mistulang ginagamit ang kapulisan na kanilang private army. Lalo na nga’t sila ang nakaupong nanunungkulan, parang nabili na nila ang mga pulis sa kanilang nasasakupan. Hindi lang yan may ilang abusadong politiko na mistula ring ginagamit na utusan ang mga pulis, na dapat naman alam din ng kapulisan kung hanggang saan sila kailangang sumunod at hindi sa isang politician."
1,"In a previous column, we traced the senators from Cebu from 1949 to 2021. There were only nine Cebuanos elected in a span of 72 years; Serge Osmeña, Sonny Osmeña, Serging Osmeña, Alejandro Almendras, Rene Espina, Marcelo Fernan, Ernesto Herrera, Mariano Jesus Cuenco, and Manuel Briones. From 1916 to 1949, there were also nine; Mario Guarina, Leoncio Imperial, Sergio Osmeña Sr., Filemon Sotto, Vicente Sotto, Celestino Rodriguez, Pedro Rodriguez, Manuel Briones, and Vicente Rama. If we consider Senate President Tito Sotto as a Cebuano, then we have only 19 in a span of 105 years. The first-ever Philippine senatorial elections were held on October 3, 1916 pursuant to the Jones Law. The country was divided into 12 senatorial districts with Cebu as the tenth. Mario Guarina and Leoncio Imperial were elected to represent us. They were reelected in 1919. In 1922, Don Sergio Osmeña and Celestino Rodriguez were voted to represent the tenth. In 1925, Pedro Rodriguez replaced Celestino while Sergio Osmeña remained. They were reelected in 1928. Then in 1931, Manuel Briones replaced Rodriguez while Osmeña remained. They were both reelected in 1934. Then the Second World War broke out. In 1941, 24 senators were elected at large. Mariano Jesus Cuenco and Vicente Rama were elected. In 1946, 16 were elected at large too. Don Vicente Sotto got the second place, next to Vicente Francisco. After Philippine independence on July 4, 1946, an election was held and the eight newly-elected senators started holding office in 1947. No Cebuano was among them. The Liberal Party dominated the elections due to the leadership of LP founder Manuel Roxas. Cebu's Sotero Cabahug, of the Nacionalista Party, was only number 14. In the 1949 elections, all winners were LP bets led by Quintin Paredes. Don Filemon Sotto was only number 20. The NP lost its steam after Manuel Quezon died, and Don Sergio Osmeña took over. He was challenged by NP party mate Manuel Roxas from Capiz in a party convention. Roxas lost. He left NP and founded the Liberal Party. After Roxas died in office he was replaced by his LP vice president Elpidio Quirino. From 1946 to 1953, the LP dominated the Senate. As flashback, when he was in the Senate, Don Sergio Osmeña was sent to the US in 1933 to head the Os-Rox (Osmeña-Roxas) Mission to lobby for the passage of the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Bill pushing for Philippine Independence. The provisions of the law were rejected by Quezon, who worked for the passage of the Tydings-McDuffie Law also for the same purpose. This caused a rift between Osmeña and Quezon, and weakened the NP. Roxas started thinking of leaving the party. But later Quezon and Osmeña reconciled. They ran for president and vice president, respectively, in 1935 and won. In 1941, they were reelected. Then war broke out and Quezon died in New York. Osmeña took over the presidency. He was challenged by Roxas in 1949 and Osmeña lost with a very slim plurality. Don Sergio is the father of Serging Osmeña who was elected senator, after serving as Cebu provincial governor and Cebu City mayor. Serging ran for president against Marcos in 1969 and lost. He even lost in the province of Cebu because practically all the congressmen favored Marcos. Then congressmen Ramon Durano and Tereso Dumon of northern Cebu campaigned very hard against Serging Osmeña. The congressmen from the south also supported Marcos, namely Manuel Zosa representing the towns in the west, from Toledo City to Ronda then called the 6th District, and Cuenco representing the old 5th District from Alcantara to Boljoon. The 4th District known as SAAD or Sibonga, Argao, Alcoy, and Dalaguete, was represented by Isidro Kintanar who also made Marcos win his district. When martial law was declared, new leaders rose in opposition to the regime, young and dynamic lawyers like Hilario Davide Jr., who later rose to become delegate to the Constitutional Convention of 1973, member of the Batasan Pambansa, then Comelec chairman, commissioner of the Constitutional Commission of 1986, associate justice then chief justice of the Supreme Court, then ambassador extraordinary plenipotentiary to the United Nations. Then Marcelo Fernan, Pablo Garcia and, of course, Eddie R. Gullas. They followed and they have their own political journeys. Cebu politics is a kaleidoscope of many colors reflecting the culture and the values of Cebuanos. I would love to write about them, one item in my bucket list, to leave as a legacy to the new breed of Cebuano leaders."
1,"The big problem with our politics is the dominance of political dynasties. Political bigwigs have made a family business out of public office. And they are not content with holding the top position of mayor, governor or president. They want wives, sons, and daughters in public office as well. That’s what’s behind the Duterte-Duterte ticket being thrown at us for next year’s presidential election. Digong, daughter Sara, and son Polong have been exchanging the mayor and vice mayor positions in Davao City for decades. Now they want to do that for the presidency. That is such a travesty on the constitutional term limit on the presidency. It is also an in-your-face insult for the rest of us who are not from Davao. They are saying the country is nothing more than a big Davao where they can do what they want. Indeed, in choosing the candidate to vote for next year, the first test a thoughtful voter must do is to check if any member of the candidate’s immediate family is holding public office. If so, there has to be a better candidate to vote for. Take the case of the Duterte family where the father, daughter, and two sons are holding public offices. Don’t they have enough skills to earn a living elsewhere? By making a family business out of public office, it is easy to put family interests ahead of public interest. Those interests are often not aligned, and once a decision is made to support the family interest, the public interest is sacrificed. All of the post-EDSA presidents, except for FVR, have wives, sons and daughters in public offices. All of them from Cory to Digong headed political dynasties. That’s one good reason why we got nowhere after the so-called EDSA revolution. We must work hard to break the pattern, but there is probably not enough time to score big for 2022. The concept that comes to mind in our search for the ideal candidate is servant leadership. We have to look for a candidate who is not running to amass political power for the family business, but primarily to serve the people. We are looking for a servant leader. An article in techtarget.com defines it: Servant leadership is a leadership philosophy built on the belief that the most effective leaders strive to serve others, rather than accrue power or take control. Our Lord Jesus Christ talked of servant leadership in Mark 10:42-45. Our Lord drew a distinction between rulers who throw their weight around and the type of leader His disciples should aspire to be. Jesus called them together and said, “You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. Not so with you. “Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all. For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” The term was coined by management expert Robert K. Greenleaf in an essay, “The Servant as Leader,” published in 1970. Greenleaf defined servant leaders as not motivated by the traditional manifestations of power: “The servant leader is servant first … It begins with the natural feeling that one wants to serve. … Then conscious choice brings one to aspire to lead. That person is sharply different from one who is leader first, perhaps because of the need to assuage an unusual power drive or to acquire material possessions… “The difference manifests itself in the care taken by the servant-first to make sure that other people’s highest priority needs are being served…” The ancient Chinese philosopher Laozi wrote about the concept in the fifth century B.C., when he described the highest type of ruler as someone who deflects attention: “The sage is self-effacing and scanty of words. When his task is accomplished and things have been completed, all the people say, ‘We ourselves have achieved it.’” It is almost impossible to find servant leaders from among politicians who are part of a political dynasty. Public office is a business for them… a source of livelihood and wealth. Dr. Ronald Mendoza of the Ateneo School of Government wrote in an academic paper: “It is the entire political structure – no anti-dynasty law, weak political parties, and an underdeveloped economy rife with patron-client relationships – as well as the absence of ancillary political reforms that probably provided over-all fertile ground for political dynasties to proliferate.” Mendoza continues: “Over the years, political dynasties appear to have grown not simply in number (more political clans), but also in heft (many clans have expanded by fielding more family members).” In his paper, Dr. Mendoza observed that “we were able to show evidence on the scale of local elected positions that fat dynasties have more and more been entrenched in the political landscape since the 1987 Constitution.” But it is not hopeless. Mendoza cited upsets during the last election like “Vico Sotto unseating the Eusebios as mayor of Pasig City or Kaka Bag-ao defeating the Ecleos for the gubernatorial seat in the Dinagat Islands for the first time since its founding…” This shows, the Ateneo paper noted, “that alternative politicians can emerge by engaging with sectors and communities, emphasizing government transparency and prioritizing essential and achievable reforms.” It was suggested that “developing and strengthening the alternative leadership pipeline could be possible by tapping into youth leadership. By building on this pool of youth leaders, it may be possible to encourage a supply of non-dynastic leaders… “In addition, promoting a more inclusive economy that reduces poverty and vulnerability may also ultimately build a strong citizenry less susceptible to traditional politics (e.g., vote-buying), and begin to debilitate longstanding patron-client relationships that tend to reinforce dynastic leadership in the country.” That’s the challenge we face. Choosing a servant leader instead of a dynasty leader is the only hope for meaningful change. As Isko Moreno puts it: “Ang pwesto sa gobyerno hindi dapat minamana.” Hindi dapat talaga!

1,"Cebu is a vote-rich province. That is why during the elections in the past years, a lot of national leaders would want to woo the Cebuano voters. It has a voting population of more than three million; a large chunk that could pull one's candidacy up to a seat in position. Recently, the administration's party held its council meeting in Cebu. It was more of a symbol, if you ask me. They wanted to show that they were still intact and that they support the current president to run next year in a position lower than what he has now. While it is his right to run for office on another term but of a different position, I think we should just step back a bit and reflect on the past five years that his administration has done to us. It was the five years where we were promised that drugs would be eradicated in six months only to find out that he couldn't fulfill his promise. We saw how those linked to the drug trade were just aimlessly, even point blank. Our own territorial properties couldn't even be defended by the state itself. We saw how the pandemic made us bleed economically and that there were a lot of displaced people. Not to mention, the trampling upon the press. If you ask me, maybe it is time for us to take a break from everything that we had just gone through in the past years. The reason for a democracy is for others, who are capable, to try their luck and be elected as well. We are embracing a diverse kind of government where it is up to the people to vote who they think deserves the seat. But as of now, it is not yet high time to talk about these things. For one, we are still rolling out the vaccination program which could spell the destiny of our country in the next few months. The response to the pandemic is still ongoing thus it is not time for people and politicians to be divisive but instead hold hands so that we could overcome this virus once and for all. Apparently, that is not the deal to some. What matters to them is a sure seat to maintain power, and that is just sad. Hopefully when we do the elections next year, we will put into mind that we need a fresh set of leaders - maybe one that does not promise change but has a heart to put our country back to where it should have been. Then again, we are still fighting tooth and bone in this pandemic for others to regain its glory again. We have lost so much, the next thing we want is losing our sovereignty. Early politics is good if you want to educate people, but trying to create factions and divisions is a long story. In fact, a lot of money will be involved in it. That money could even belong to the people, so think wisely."
1,"Manny Pacquiao should stay in boxing. In the ring, you let your fists do the talking. You do not unnecessarily open your mouth, or your mouthpiece will fly out. In the ring, Manny is king. Politics is another thing. If you are serious, the way Cebu Governor Gwen Garcia is, you let deeds do the talking not talk making all the doing. “Buhat ang pasultihon, dili sulti ang pabuhaton,” she loves to say in Cebuano, which Manny understands perfectly. Manny is, first and foremost, a boxer. Proof of this is that even now that he is already a senator, he continues to fight professionally. In fact, it won’t be long now before he will fly off again to fight in Las Vegas, this time against Errol Spence. Yet no one among his fellow politicians is telling Manny to lay off politics and just concentrate on boxing. Even among politicians, there seems to be an unspoken code of respect, or even just courtesy. Yet yesterday, Manny lashed out at Alfonso Cusi, telling the energy secretary to focus on the looming energy crisis in Luzon instead of delving this early into politics ahead of the 2022 presidential election, which the boxer himself, by most accounts, plans to join as a presidential candidate. He is miffed at Cusi for heeding President Duterte who wanted their PDP-Laban party to convene for a meeting in Cebu City last Monday. Manny has a reason to be miffed. The meeting ended with a unanimous resolution urging Duterte to run for vice president, with the power to choose who he wants as presidential standard-bearer, which Manny knows is not going to be him. That is the real reason for his calling out Cusi. And while he does have a point about Cusi and energy, Manny, who has built a record for many absences, is hard-pressed to sound as if he really cares. Manny looks like a wet bag standing up against too much politicking. He should be told that standing up against politicking is itself politicking. Or does he not know? In which case I reiterate my call for him to stay out of politics and remain in boxing. If he cannot understand just how simply politics works -- which is that from day one of your election you start working on the next election -- then he has no business staying in this profession. But since this is a free country and Manny is of course free to make politics his golden parachute when he finally jumps off the boxing ring, please let it not be at our expense. The two times that Manny has opened his mouth, first in a laughable comment about Duterte and his jet ski, and now this about politicking, have shown us the exact weight, as in boxing, of his political being. And it is not the weight meant for presidents. Manny can inhabit the glorified atmosphere of senators for as long as allowed. As they say, senators are virtual republics unto themselves. He can choose to stay within the limits of just two talking moments in a lifetime, or talk all he wants of politics and not tire of politicking. But never complain of what goes on in the environment of your own choosing, especially if you are just pretending, or worse, not at all understanding. Or Manny can keep on boxing, even if the Spence fight could very well be his final fight. And if he emerges from that fight unscathed, he can devote the remainder of his life helping those in the sport he loves who will never be like him. The choice is his. As to his presidential longings, perish the thought, Manny, for the choice is ours. Unless God intervenes, there will not be a President Pacquiao of the Philippines addressing the UN."
1,"The current debate among our politicians is whether to announce what brand of vaccine is being administered for the day. Apparently, certain brands have greater cachet among the unvaccinated, and when the brand of choice is announced, a mad scramble occurs. Picky people show up, hoping to be injected with their preferred brand. That’s what happened in Parañaque. When Pfizer was offered, a swarm descended upon the vaccination center. So, the quick fix is to tell the cities not to announce the particular brand upfront. That would forestall choosy citizens from lying in wait for their desired brand, and avoid the jam-packing of vaccination centers. However, a couple of mayors bristle at this injunction. For Mayor Isko Moreno of Manila, “it’s their right to choose the vaccine that will be injected to them...it’s your body, it’s your right to take care of it and choose what vaccine will be injected to you depending on the availability of the vaccines”. Mayor Toby Tiangco of Navotas, in turn, thinks the unvaccinated “have greater confidence if they are allowed to choose, and we can encourage more people to get jabs”. As a natural consequence of these positions, both these mayors want to overturn the decision not to divulge the brand of the day. Frankly, I’m not sure allowing our citizens this much flexibility is helpful from a public health perspective. The focus should be in jabbing the unprotected as quick as we can. Given the tens of millions of citizens left to still vaccinate, and the millions of vaccines that may go to waste if they aren’t quickly deployed, getting a vaccination shouldn’t be turned into a leisurely shopping expedition. Factor in as well the fact that the pace of our vaccination hasn’t been ideal, what’s with the daily average only coming out to about 83,240 doses a day (I refer you to the Reuters vaccination tracker, which reports only a bit more than 3 million doses administered thus far). At this rate, Reuters calculates that it will take 260 days just to complete 10% of our total population. What this statistic means to my simplistic mind is, it will take seven years before we fully dose the country. And not to be facetious about it, but after the first year, all of those who got their vaccines will probably need booster shots all over again. In which case, how the heck will we ever finish injecting ourselves with this vaccine? Do we really want to finish this arduous task? Or do we want to prolong it so that the choosy can take their time before protecting not just themselves, but also everybody else around them? That seems to be the point missed by the mayors. It isn’t just about protecting the individual. Or his or her body. It isn’t just a personal choice for one person. It’s also about protecting the rest of society. That is why, for other diseases like measles and polio, other countries have mandated vaccines. And, to back up that requirement, there are stiff penalties attached to refusing to be vaccinated. A study by McGill University points to 105 out of 193 countries that have imposed vaccinations for this and that disease, and also some form of penalty to refusing to comply. And these penalties include fines, jail time, being refused admission to school for unvaccinated children, or even losing parental rights. The only thing that’s staying the hand of certain countries from applying this rule to COVID-vaccines is probably the fact that the current options have had only a short proof-of-concept life. But once these vaccines prove their safety longevity, we may all end up considering the issue of mandating COVID-vaccines. And if we do - we will be in big trouble. We are so not prepared to mandate the administration of COVID-vaccines to a hundred million Filipinos. Meanwhile, let’s not dither about deploying those jabs. This isn’t a restaurant setting where one can come in and order dessert according to taste. The customer isn’t, in fact, a customer. The vaccine is free - in which case the adage “beggars can’t be choosers” comes to mind."
1,"Indeed, it is true as a political sage wrote centuries ago, those who do not learn from the bitter lessons of the past are bound to suffer from them again. History has a nasty habit of repeating itself since people never learn from the mistakes of their predecessors. The 2022 political scenario will be the exact duplicate of the presidential derby in 1992, or exactly 30 years before. A political deja vu is in the offing. Seven candidates vied for president in 1992 and that situation favored the candidate who was endorsed by the outgoing president. If Miriam and FVR fought one-on-one, Miriam would have won hands down. The multiplicity of choices favored the administration because the antis were fragmented and Cory's forces were united behind FVR. After the term of a popular president, Cory Aquino, in 1992, the ruling coalition disintegrated and broke into the Lakas of FVR, the LDP of Mitra, the LP of Salonga, the NP of Doy Laurel and the PRP of Miriam. The feisty candidate from Iloilo was a part of the Cory government as she was appointed DAR secretary after her sterling tenure in the Bureau of Immigration. FVR was the Defense Secretary, and Ramon Mitra was really a blood brother of Ninoy both in the pre-martial law Senate and in the struggles against Marcos. Laurel was Cory's vice president. When Cory anointed FVR, Mitra defected and carried with him our excellent chief justice, Marcelo Briones Fernan to political debacle and oblivion. It was Fernan's historic mistake to have fought Cory who named him the chief magistrate of the land. The opposition was also fragmented with Danding's NPC and Imelda's KBL. Cebu supported FVR because Lito Osmeña was his vice presidential bet. The other candidates carried their respective bailiwicks: Imelda got the solid north and Leyte solidly for her, including a large chunk of Mindanao. Panay including Iloilo, Aklan, Antique, Capiz, and Guimaras together with Negros Occidental and the Ilongo-heavy vote-rich Cotabato and Metro Manila supported Miriam all the way. Danding had Central Luzon and Mitra got Palawan and Bohol, surprisingly. Where did FVR get his votes? Cebu and two thirds of Mindanao, including the northern, southern, and western side, this was where Miriam alleged that she won in the voting but lost in the counting. FVR was credited with 5.3 million votes, Miriam. 4.46 million, Danding, 4.1 million; Mitra, 3.33 million, Imelda, 2.3 million, Salonga, 2.30 million, and the poor Doy Laurel was biting the dust with a little more than 600,000 votes. The vice presidential contest was a different story. Erap was Danding's running mate and got 6.7 million, more than double that of Cojuangco. Our dear Fernan was a distant second placer with 4.4 million, followed by Lito Osmeña (FVR's running mate) with 3.36 million. Had Fernan and Lito united, they would have beaten Erap. The other vice presidential bets were rock bottom: Ramon Magsaysay Jr. of Miriam; Nenen Pimentel of Salonga, Vic Magsaysay of Imelda. Yes, there were two Magsaysays running, these guys never learned a basic lesson in Philippine politics. Eva Kalaw, Doy Laurel's VP ended her glorious career in monumental ignominy with a little more than 200,000 votes. But the senatatorial derby was dominated by LDP winning 16 out of 24 seats, and the others were divided by Danding's NPC and FVR's Lakas with only two women winning, Rasul and Letty Shahani, FVR's sister. LDPs dominated the Senate with the winners from highest Tito Sotto, Revilla Sr., Angara, our Boy Herrera, Romulo, Maceda, Mercado, Gonzales, Alvarez, Ople, and Webb serving for six years. Those serving for three years were, among others, GMA, Roco, Tañada, and Sonny Osmeña as number 23 among the 24 winners. Next year, this scenario will be reenacted. If VP Leni Robredo, Inday Sara, Bongbong, Manny Pacquaio, Grace Poe, Trillanes, and Bong Go will all run, that is exactly seven just like in 1992. And that will be the end of the opposition. Precisely because all of them will be divided, Mindanao will favor the candidate of Manong Digong. Even Inday will most probably give way to Bong and become Senate president instead. We will then have more of Duterte for the next six years till 2029, and perhaps we all deserve it."
1,"TOP PICKS. After hearing the buzz about the new opposition political coalition called Isambayan, a political observer said the opposition better choose their candidates right this time. “Hinumdumi ‘tong Otso Diretso, nahimong Zero Diretso,” he said about the much-touted group of opposition candidates during the 2019 mid-term elections that totally bombed."
1,"It is an acceptable proposition that the thing Filipinos most dabble in next to basketball is politics. Well, that the reverse may be true only strengthens our pre-occupancy with this democratic process called elections. One incident few nights ago tended to support my theory. While I was viewing the news program of ABS-CBN called TV Patrol, I noticed the plug that its serialized soap opera entitled “Ang Probinsiyano” would follow after the news. Actually, I was a follower of that show until some members of the House of Representatives, on a plethora of confused reasoning, mainly politics, refused to grant a franchise to the network. The plug that evening rekindled my interest in Cardo Dalisay. But, as I was trying to reconnect to Coco Martin, a telephone call came. On the other end of the line, a friend wove into the title of the TV action-drama series a political angle. He talked about Ang Probinsiyana, highlighting the female gender. In a surprising twist, he conversed not about the male Cardo but on a female political leader whom he named as Governor Gwendolyn Garcia. In the last two decades, the Cebuano members of the Philippine Senate were two Osmeña grandsons of the late President Sergio Osmeña Sr. Senator Sonny, who recently passed away, led the way in many an intelligent legislative debate. Friends of mine labelled him an adroit politician. His cousin, Sen. Serge, perceptively more Manileño than Cebuano, was the other senator. After talking briefly but reverently on Sonny and Serge, my caller mentioned that 2022 is about the time we send a blue-blooded Bisaya, but not an Osmeña, to the upper chamber. According to him, he is pushing for Gwen and believe me, he has my concurrence for I too think that the lady governor can be a good senator. Did not my friend show his predisposition for politics than most other major social issues like COVID-19? The total voting population of Cebu Province, where Gwen holds sway, makes it her veritable launching pad. There are more than three million voters in the province. The electors of highly-urbanized cities of Cebu City, about 700,000; Mandaue City, 220,000; and Lapu-Lapu City, 215,000 or a combined number of over 1,100,000 can constitute good statistical basis for Gwen’s senatorial aspiration. The lessons of President Rodrigo Duterte’s 2016 elections, here in the entire Cebu Island, blaze the electoral trail the Probinsiyana can follow. In 2016, President Rodrigo Duterte, running under a supposedly less-organized party, ran roughshod over the presumably highly-oiled Liberal Party. PDP-Laban was comparably speaking, then a Lilliputian. In the eventual tally, Roxas’ over half a million votes, did not even get one half of Duterte’s over one million. On Duterte’s battle cry “Bisaya ni”, he needed no other propaganda spiel. Perhaps the regionalistic Cebuanos wanted the Bisaya Duterte to win over Ilongo Roxas. Let me repeat that this is a good track open for the lady governor. Aside from her political opponents, (and they are not few) there are Gwen detractors, of course, given her high brow. But, no matter what her adversaries say of her, we can be sure that the interest of Cebu and the Cebuanos ranks high in her agenda such that we can forget our different political colors and give her the volume of voters we supported Duterte with in 2016. Wrapped in the label Ang Probinsiyana, Gov Gwen is a true-Blue Cebuana compared to Duterte’s Bisaya claim. If you agree, then there is a better chance you, like me, will blacken Gwen’s number in the ballot’s senatorial candidates in 2022."
1,"History has an uncanny manner of repeating itself. What happened in 1986 is most likely to duplicate itself in next year's presidential showdown. A widow, Cory, the underdog candidate in 1986 achieved what was then seen as inconceivable, a victory of a David against a political Goliath. In 2022, another widow is expected to defeat another Ferdinand Marcos. In the 1986 snap presidential elections, a very reluctant, unprepared, and much pressured widow, Corazon Aquino, trounced Ferdinand Marcos, the seemingly unbeatable martial law dictator, despite his heavy loads of money, and notwithstanding his total and untrammelled control over the impregnable military, and his strong-arm domination over all institutions of the martial law government, including Comelec and the courts. If Cory did not defeat Marcos, in the polls, she made him flee in fear to Hawaii in the dead of the night, because of the massive EDSA uprising. In 2022, or after 36 years, another widow, Leni Gerona Robredo is most likely to make Bongbong bite the dust again. VP Leni is much more prepared than Tita Cory was then. She is a lawyer, a former congresswoman and a duly-elected vice president with more than 14 million votes to her name. A few days before the Supreme Court, En Banc, promulgated that historic unanimous (15-0) decision dismissing the election protest filed by former Senator Ferdinand Marcos Jr. against the vice president, this column came up with a piece titled “VP Leni Robredo is a viable presidential timber”. That piece has become viral all over the world, from America to New Zealand. Filipinos in Europe, Middle East, South America, and Asia reached out to this writer expressing their concurrence. After the release of that landmark decision, the viral level has reached geometric proportions. I realized that VP Leni is very popular, more so, after defeating Bongbong, not just in the elections but in his protest. The Supreme Court victory is Bongbong Marcos' Rubicon and Waterloo. That staggering win by knockout by a fragile lady knocking down a very strong opponent sealed the fate of VP Leni. Marcos can never recover from that killer punch. The massive flood of millions of votes from a united Bicol and Southern Luzon is expected to inundate the Solid North of the Marcoses. Metro Manila, led by the passionate and idealists students and the disgruntled urban poor, will give Bongbong a run for his money. The strong support of the Church and the business community for Leni will surprise Bongbong with a big campaign kitty. The combined strong support of Western Visayas led by Senator Franklin Drilon and Mar Roxas will converge with the progressive, liberal-minded, and younger voters from Cebu, Bohol, Negros Oriental, and Siquijor. If VP Leni can get a strong vice presidential teammate from Mindanao or from Central Visayas, then Bongbong should prepare to flee to Hawaii in the greatest debacle of his political career. If Mayor Inday Sara is going to run, that will make the Leni camp all the more confident. That would divide the votes that are aligned with the Marcos-Duterte alliance. GMA, the favorite daughter of the LP stalwart, President Diosdado Macapagal, will never support Bongbong. Ferdinand Marcos defeated Diosdado Macapagal in 1965, despite the fact that both FM and DM were Liberals. Marcos bolted the LP and joined the NP, edging out Fernando Lopez and Emmanuel Pelaez. If GMA will not support Bongbong, then the vote-rich Central Luzon will go for Leni because PNoy is still the kingpin of Tarlac. The Cojuangcos of San Miguel and Hacienda Luisita will never go for Marcos, after all that the Marcoses did to the Aquinos and the Cojuangcos. All the cards are now on the side of Leni. She should play these cards well. She should forge an alliance with Alan Peter Cayetano who was jilted by President Duterte in favor of Jay Lord Alan Velasco. VP Leni should talk to senators Koko Pimentel and Migz Zubiri of Mindanao, and even Manny Pacquiao. Who knows, Pacman may agree to run as vice president to VP Robredo. A Robredo-Pacquiao tandem can cause Bongbong many sleepless nights, even if Cynthia Villar will run as Bongbong's VP. I am very excited. I may be the first to have sleepless nights. But, I am betting on the widow against the son of the dictator who jailed me as a student leader during martial law. I have an axe to grind too."
1,"We are fortunate to live in an era where etymologists and grammarians are collaborating to come up with new words or phrases that are politically appropriate.  So that, as we now often hear, the physically disabled is now called differently abled. Those who are mentally retarded are now referred to as mentally-challenged. Those who are not blessed with height are now called vertically challenged. There are phrases too that have been coined because some words were perceived to have negative connotations. For instance, the phrase “thoughts showering” is now widely used instead of the word “brainstorming.” They go for it because storming or forcing the brain to come out with great ideas does not do anything good at all, etymologists say.  “Thoughts showering” on the other hand, encourages one’s mind to think and come up with great ideas freely. Maybe, as fashion lovers, trendsetters or fashionistas are running out of spaces in their closets and are wanting to create  more room for new trends, they must have gathered and had countless of thoughts showering sessions to come up with  more politically appropriate words for it too. So that, they are able to come up with words like “preowned” or “preloved”. Undeniably, unless you opt to dump them in a trash bin, using the words “preowned or preloved” are better than “second hand” or “used” when referring to any old items that you wish to sell or dispose.  In doing so, not only that you can recoup a portion of what you’ve spent  in buying them, the buyer will  be delighted on the fact that those items were once in the hands of a person who loved them, thus, took care of them. Obviously, a good number of buyers will go for preowned or preloved items. For one, it could mean buying a branded item and spending just a fraction of the price if it were brand new. Therefore, huge savings that can be used to buy other necessities. Also, it will be a good feeling for the buyer (especially if an environmentalist) to be able to support the green initiatives by avoiding further drain of our natural resources (for raw materials) in manufacturing new products. Not to mention, the consequential pollution during production. True enough, we are now in an era of fast fashion. So, if you are a trendsetter or a shopaholic, your closets must be awash with garments by this time. Your racks must be filled with shoes and bags to the max.  So, instead of just letting those rats and termites feast on them, you can either give them to charity (or to their beneficiaries) for their use or sell them and recover a few pesos for your next buys. You don’t need to have a garage sale. That’s antiquated. You can always sell your old items online. Apart from Shopee or Shopify, there is another online marketplace that really deals with preloved or preowned items, Carousell. It is as simple as taking a photo of your item, uploading it, tagging it with the appropriate category, give a brief description and set your price. That easy, and you can do that in any of these platforms. Simply put, in just a few minutes, you are off and running. More importantly, though the motivation in selling old items is cleaning out your closet, still, it is worth knowing what items really sell fast and how? Curtsy (the fastest growing app that deals with preloved items in the USA), supports “most types of women’s clothing that are in new, like-new, or excellent condition with no stains or damage.” They recommend “selling what you would still want to buy.” Notably, “items that were purchased in the last few years from recognizable brands sell best.” In their experience, the “fastest selling items include those with photos of the item on a person: either the stock photos from the retailer's website, or the seller modeling it.” However, to sell really fast, good photos will not be enough, the price is still a very strong determinant. After all, buyers prefer preloved items because of that. So, the lower your price is, the faster it will sell. Undeniably, you need to do both."
1,"We have to understand this phenomenon very well, especially these days when a lot of people are going through all kinds of suffering, physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, moral, financial, social, political and a long etcetera. When we understand it well, we would have the chance to take advantage of suffering, since suffering can open up a lot of good things for us. Suffering is not just a purely negative thing in our life. We cannot help but suffer with everyone else, because whether we are aware of it or not, we are actually interconnected with one another. When one suffers, everybody else also suffers. Yes, we suffer too. This truth about ourselves can be described in many ways: that we are in the same boat, we belong to the same body, we are actually one family, we cannot help but live in some communion among ourselves. Let’s remember what St. Paul said in this regard. “If one part suffers, every part suffers with it. If one part is honored, every part rejoices with it.” (1 Cor 12,26) And this is made possible because God has designed us to be so. We actually form not only one body in Christ but also parts of the very body of Christ, who is the pattern of our humanity and the savior of our damaged humanity. As such, he assumed all the suffering of all men due to sin. Christ is the very epitome of what is known as “vicarious suffering,” since he, who need not suffer, chose to suffer for us and with us. If we want to conform ourselves to this pattern and savior of our humanity, then we ought to have the same attitude Christ had and continues to have toward the suffering of men. We have to learn to choose to suffer for and with one another! We have to be eager to have the vicarious suffering for the others. And these days, with so many suffering around, we should realize that we have a golden opportunity to identify ourselves more with Christ by suffering with and for the others. In this regard, it would be good if we are always aware of the suffering of others. We should be pro-active in this. We should not just wait for others to tell us they are suffering. We have to take the initiative. And our own suffering should not prevent us from thinking also of the suffering of the others. In fact, our own suffering would become useful and more bearable if we go through it with the suffering of the others, offering it to God and making it part of the continuing suffering of Christ that is meant for our redemption. Thus our suffering that we convert also as a vicarious suffering for the others would also become a share of the redemptive suffering of Christ. With this understanding of suffering, our fear of it disappears, and instead of fear, we would have an eager desire for it. Suffering becomes a very positive element in our life. Just as Christ embraced his suffering, his cross and his death, so should be our attitude toward all kinds of suffering, whether it is ours or those of others. We should suffer with and for everybody else. This way, we suffer with Christ also. We identify ourselves with him more, and our suffering becomes redemptive."
1,"Perhaps the world will be more peaceful if people, especially politicians, stop talking too much and try listening more. Also, we, commentators, journalists, netizens should stop the propensity for fault-finding and shift to more positive reinforcement. The problem with talking is that once you say the word, and once you inflict pain, cause insults, ignite anger, and provoke retaliation, it becomes very difficult to undo what has been done. Words are powerful, both in the positive and negative sense, mostly negative. In geo-politics and foreign relations, wars may be triggered by a reckless word of a head of state or a provocative speech delivered by a foreign dignitary. Relations between and among states, or among neighbors in a community or between husband and wife may create conflict that will be very difficult to repair. There are presidents who talk too much and some of them are impeached for inciting sedition, others are charged with summary executions or extra-judicial killings, because of loose talk that may be interpreted as admissions against interests. Still others are labelled as sexist, racist, or sexual perverts because of too much loquaciousness. Listening is more courteous, respectful and polite. It promotes goodwill and diplomacy. Some very effective communicators listen more and talk less. We should learn from the Dalai Lama: ""When you talk, you are only repeating what you already know. When you listen, you may learn something new.” Gautama Buddha advised: “Speak only when you strongly feel that your words are better than the silence.” Lao Tzu said: ""Silence is a source of great strength.” William Shakespeare wrote: ""Words are easy like the wind. Faithful friends are hard to find. Have more than your words can show. Speak less than what you really know.” The best leaders are not known to be the best speakers. For achievements aren’t generated by words, only by silent decisions and unassuming actions. We should learn less criticism and more appreciation. Many columnists in print and broadcast find glory or fame in negative comments rather than in positive reinforcements. These come about as a recurrent phenomenon precisely because the public seems to applaud more those who focus on faults, excesses, and imperfections as opposed to those who see beauty even in the most atrocious events and circumstances. The culture of negativism indicates a sick society, a nation that expresses its defense mechanisms via bitter words and stinging rebukes is actually a community of people with distorted values and shattered national soul. Negative words spread over the media or internet poison the hopes of the people and weaken a country. Our unsolicited counsel to our readers is simple: Talk less, listen more and learn to appreciate always. Restrain yourselves when you’re tempted to blurt out insults or sarcasm. Keep the air unpolluted by the stench and decay of verbal or written garbage. Save humanity from the venom of your spoken or printed slings and arrows of outrageous expressions. There’s more than enough poison already scattered by tyrants, scoundrels, rascals, and scalawags. Life on this planet is already overwhelmed by the burdens of too many miscreant charlatans. Please don’t exacerbate the atmosphere of negativism pervading our atmosphere. The best advice I received when I was a boy of five, was from my maternal great-grandfather, Tatang Ino: “If you have nothing pleasant to say, you will be more admired if you keep your mouth shut.” Today, each time I get into trouble when I say something or write something nasty in my column, I always catch myself, remember his admonition, and hear myself blessing his soul. No talk, no mistake."
1,"It is a pity that we were taught too many subjects in schools that may be useful in earning a living, but we were deprived of the knowledge of the most valuable lessons, that could have empowered us with wisdom on how to live life, and on how to make our lives more meaningful. We were shortchanged by our educators and our parents failed to fill in the blanks that universities and colleges left unanswered. We were not taught what really matters most in life. And so, better late than later, may I share what I have discovered during the pandemic lockdowns: The first lesson that was not taught is that life is unfair, and that we are not all created equal. Some are born in castles and palatial mansions, while others came into this world inside a shanty or barong-barong. That others grew up with silver spoons in their mouths while other children had to beg or scavenge in trash cans and garbage bins to look for food. And some are born with better IQ and EQ or with talents and gifts, while others come out as morons, imbeciles, or nincompoops. And that we play life's games where the rules are not fair. Second, they never taught us that people are wearing masks, not just for COVID but as defense mechanisms, and that that most humans are trying very hard to cover up their own realities, because of fears that others would not accept the truths in them. Third, our parents and teachers did not tell us that life is a marathon, and the winners get all the prizes and the losers bite the dust. More so, we were not told that there are runners who are wearing expensive sports shoes, complete with all the gadgets, and running paved roads, while others are running barefoot on thorny and rocky paths. Fourth, the schools and other institutions never told us that sometimes, the bad guys who often cheat do win over the honest ones. We were never told that there are very good people inside Bilibid, while there are rascals in high government offices, in the police force, in the military or in the courts. As there are also scoundrels among the rebels and revolutionaries. Fifth, we were not even told that a Ph.D. or even a college diploma are not really essentials to become multi-billionaires, as exemplified by Bill Gates, Manny Pacquiao and many others, that you do not have to be brilliant to be elected senator or congressman, and that even a college dropout can be elected president. Sixth, our professors never told us that success is not due to hard work or intelligence, or good looks alone, o to good luck, or excellent feng shui, but by a confluence of a lot of more factors, including guns, gold, and goons, and manipulating the counting machines. Seventh, we should have been told that money is not the root of all evil. It is the love of money that bedevils man and makes him a monster or a greedy politician. That officials can be charged with plunder and then be acquitted, but ordered to return hundreds of millions to the government, and that even if charged with such a grievous crime, he could still be reelected, by the grace of a very forgiving electorate. He could win by just dancing on TV, while the more honest and competent ones could not even get near the winning circle. Eighth, it is not really the more deserving who wins, but the one who is endorsed by the most powerful. And all these notwithstanding, in this land of noble heroes, all is fair in love and politics. Ninth, in life, career, and politics, your wife and your family can either uplift you or cause your downfall. And that the trapos love for, and loyalty to, his family, wives or girlfriends often drive them to corruption, plunder, and all sorts of shenanigans. Tenth, in life and in all endeavors, including love and politics, success has many fathers. Failure is an orphan. When you are in power, they all worship you and kiss your hands. When you are out, they will not even return your call. It is a pity that we learn all these outside the classrooms, and often too late."
